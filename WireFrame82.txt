"Text": "By Denis PombriantNov 2, 2019 4:00 AM PT The Pentagon last week awarded its US$10 billion contract for cloud computing to Microsoft. The program which goes by the acronym \"JEDI\" for \"Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure\" has been attracting vendors like a dog attracts fleas for several years. It has been marked by fierce litigation too, so the award may not be the end of it.\nOracle sued over the process, claiming it was unfair. It focused its ire on Amazon, which appeared to be the leading candidate. CTO Larry Ellison made a point of showcasing the benchmarks of Oracle's Autonomous Database against Amazon at multiple OpenWorld conferences to show Oracle's technical dominance.\nAmazon had been making a market share argument along the lines of \"we have the most datacenters so we're the best.\" Cloud computing is a three legged stool, though, and you need infrastructure, software and tools to be a real contender. Thumb on Scale?\nThen Donald Trump got involved, as only he can as the commander in chief. There's no love lost on Trump's part for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post. Trump dismisses the paper as the \"Amazon Washington Post,\" making a not so sharp distinction from his description of the \"failing New York Times.\"\n\"An upcoming book on James Mattis' tenure as secretary of Defense claims President Donald Trump told Mattis to 'screw Amazon' out of a $10 billion cloud contract for the Pentagon,\" wrote James Feuer in a CNBC article published last week.\nMission accomplished, I guess. If true, that looks like self dealing rather than putting the concerns of national security first and foremost, but I digress.\nMore than all the gossip about who gets the contract, there ought to be questions about what the contract will do to shape the cloud industry. Where to begin? Microsoft and Who Else?\nFirst, is Microsoft the only contractor in this deal or is it the prime? The difference could be big. If the company founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen is the prime, it leaves the door open for the losers in the derby to make strategic contributions.\nFor instance, it defies logic to think that the Oracle Autonomous Database would be excluded from delivering its functionality for national defense. In my humble opinion it is the most performant and secure thing in the cloud, and I say this not to dispute other products' greatness but only to point out that Oracle has delivered a hardware and software solution to market that achieves that purpose.\nThis brings up a thorny issue. To get the most out of Oracle's technology, you really have to buy its Exadata storage system and maybe some other pieces. It's a standard part of the Oracle cloud system now being deployed, but it might raise concerns about vendor lock in for a customer that likes to have no single point of potential failure. For Oracle to get a piece of the contract, it might have to bend a little by making its solution more open.\nThat's not far fetched. Oracle and Microsoft have been cozying up this summer, with grand strategies to make their systems more open to each other. A coincidence? I think not. It's interesting to me that Oracle quit making headlines about its JEDI lawsuit after August.\nMore interesting is that as much as Trump wanted to \"screw\" Amazon, he didn't seem to offer help to his friend Safra Catz who is now CEO of Oracle. The Cloud Computing Utility\nI've written frequently that the IT industry is commoditizing and that a utility is forming. An IT or cloud computing utility might look similar to the electricity industry in which many vendors adhere to accepted standards and present the appearance of a continental grid (it's not a single grid but that's a story for another time).\nIf all of that is true, then Microsoft sits in position to become the standard setter and gatekeeper. There would be a lot of contention over databases, but perhaps the Oracle product might be used in large, ultra secure situations.\nMaybe Oracle and Microsoft also would agree on the central importance of Exadata as the hardware foundation too. There are lots of permutations, but most importantly JEDI might force a truce and foster better interactivity standards, some of which are clearly under way.\nIn that kind of environment there also might be room for IBM's Watson and Amazon's datacenters, as well as other advanced technology. My Two Bits\nI can't fathom how the award could be the end of the story. In a lot of procurements, the government puts itself in the position of choosing the best and most viable vendor and of telling all the others the equivalent of \"your baby is ugly.\" That's not the case here.\nAmerica brims with technology talent and products (a consequence of the government sponsored space race, ultimately), so each contender could have done a credible job of at least being the prime contractor.\nThe big impact of the deal will be how it shapes cooperation among the oligarchy that now controls much of our technology future.\nThe CIA bought relational database technology from a startup named Oracle in the 1980s, and a relatively young Larry Ellison became its chief support person at least for a time. Relational databases were much better at managing data and reporting than the flat file systems then in use. Even Oracle's company name suggests being able to predict the future in the way that the ancient Greek Oracle at Delphi did.\nThat win spawned the RDBMS revolution. We all became SQL fluent, and Oracle never looked back.\nThe JEDI contract feels like one of those moments when a government procurement can change an industry. That's why it was so closely contested, and why I think we'll now see the industry coming together and creating new interoperability standards.

Click here for more BI Prime stories.\nMicrosoft and SAP just unveiled a new partnership that would make it easier for the German software maker's customers to move to the US tech giant's cloud platform.\nThe move highlights Microsoft's push to strengthen its position against Amazon in the cloud by forging alliances with rivals in the enterprise software market, including its archnemesis, Oracle. For SAP, the partnership promises to boost the company's ability to maintain and strengthen its relationship with its more than 400,000 customers, many of whom are looking to access applications in the public cloud.\nIn fact, many of them were clearly drawn to Azure, Microsoft's platform, SAP's new co CEO Jennifer Morgan said. Morgan, who is the former president of SAP's cloud business, and Christian Klein, SAP's former chief operating officer, were named co CEOs two weeks ago after longtime CEO Bill McDermott announced he was stepping down.\nMorgan said many of SAP's largest customers \"were very clear with us that they had already chosen to move their largest workloads to Azure or had plans to do that.\"\n\"A lot of times with companies today, everything is about either I win or you win,\" she told Business Insider of the decision to work with Microsoft, a longtime rival. \"It's not a zero sum game anymore.\"\nBut it's a potentially big win for Microsoft, which is now \"SAP's preferred cloud,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in an emailed statement to Business Insider.\n\"Our unique and extensive partnership with SAP will help organizations accelerate their journeys to the cloud,\" Nadella said. \"With Azure as SAP's preferred cloud, we will make it faster and easier for customers to migrate to Azure, unlocking new business opportunities and innovation.\"\nThe new partnership would make it easier for SAP customers who use the company's applications on private data centers or on its private cloud platform to migrate seamlessly to the Microsoft public platform where they would be able to access SAP's cloud based tools.\nThe Microsoft SAP announcement follows a series of earlier agreements, including a 2017 partnership directed at making it easier for customers use one another's applications and platforms. Versus Amazon\nThe partnership could make Microsoft more competitive against Amazon, the dominant player in the cloud, the fast growing trend that lets businesses to set up networks on web based platforms, making it possible for them to scale down or abandon private data centers. This trend has disrupted the traditional enterprise software market in which SAP, Microsoft, and Oracle are competitors.\nMicrosoft has also been stressing a so called hybrid approach to the cloud for businesses that want to make the move but still hope to maintain huge chunks of its data and applications in private data centers. Given its bigger footprint in the enterprise market, where products like Windows are ubiquitous, Microsoft is widely seen as having an edge over Amazon in this trend.\nMicrosoft is clearly also using alliances to gain an edge over Amazon. In June, the Redmond, Washington based company unveiled a new partnership with Oracle , which is making its own bid to be a stronger player in the main cloud infrastructure arena. Judson Althoff, the executive vice president of Microsoft's worldwide commercial business, said its partnership with SAP was deeper and more comprehensive.\n\"We're not stepping forward and reselling Oracle,\" Althoff told Business Insider, saying that the Oracle arrangement is focused more on making it easier for businesses to run their networks on both platforms. \"Oracle business applications don't run natively on Azure. With SAP, we're very far along in having optimized native capabilities\" of SAP software available to customers. 'Strong move by Microsoft'\nThe analyst Ian Campbell, the CEO of Nucleus Research, said the move made sense for Microsoft as it looks to strengthen its cloud business.\n\"Strong move by Microsoft since it's clear the future of Azure is in supporting all solutions, not just those from Redmond,\" he told Business Insider. \"Azure needs to grow and supporting all comers is key. The Microsoft apps folks need to compete, and they are doing a great job, so there's no need to hamper Azure's growth by shunning Microsoft competitors.\"\nSAP is not a major player in the public cloud platform business, but the Microsoft alliance underscores its own cloud strategy, which focuses heavily on expanding the reach of its cloud applications, especially within its huge customer base. Morgan said it was a strategy that recognizes the desire of many customers to work with a variety of vendors and platforms.\n\"Just like Judson is going to have customers who run Oracle, we've got customers who maybe running on AWS or GCP,\" Morgan said, referring to Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, the other major cloud platform.\nGot a tip about Microsoft, SAP or another tech company?

Bidding for the huge project, known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, pitted leading tech titans Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle and IBM against one another.\nThe giant contract has attracted more attention than most, sparked by speculation early in the process that Amazon would be the sole winner of the deal. Tech giants Oracle and IBM pushed back with their own bids and also formally protested the bidding process last year.\nOracle later challenged the process in federal court, but lost.\nTrump waded into the fray in July, saying that the administration would \"take a very long look\" at the process, saying he had heard complaints. Trump has frequently expressed his ire for Amazon and founder Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post. At the time, he said other companies told him that the contract \"wasn't competitively bid.\"\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper recused himself from the controversial bidding process earlier this week, citing a conflict of interest because his son works for one of the companies that originally bid.\n The JEDI system will store and process vast amounts of classified data, allowing the U.S. military to use artificial intelligence to speed up its war planning and fighting capabilities.\nA cloud strategy document unveiled by the Defense Department last year called for replacing the military's \"disjointed and stove piped information systems\" with a commercial cloud service \"that will empower the warfighter with data and is critical to maintaining our military's technological advantage.\"\nThe Pentagon emphasized in an announcement that the process was fair and followed procurement guidelines. It noted that over the past two years, it has awarded more than $11 billion in ten separate cloud computing contracts, and said the JEDI award \"continues our strategy of a multi vendor, multi cloud environment.\"\nThe latter statement appeared designed to address previous criticism about awarding such a large deal to one company.\nThe deal is a major win for Microsoft's cloud business Azure, which has long been playing catch up to Amazon's market leading Amazon Web Services. Microsoft said it was preparing a statement.\nAmazon said Friday it was surprised by the decision.\n\"AWS is the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion,\" Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said in a statement. \"We remain deeply committed to continuing to innovate for the new digital battlefield where security, efficiency, resiliency, and scalability of resources can be the difference between success and failure.\"\nAccording to a July report from the research firm Gartner, Amazon holds almost 48% of the market for public cloud computing, followed by Microsoft in second place with close to 16%.\nOver the last year, Microsoft has positioned itself as a friend to the U.S. military. President Brad Smith wrote last fall that Microsoft has long supplied technology to the military and would continue to do so, despite pushback from employees.\nOracle and IBM were eliminated earlier in the process, leaving Microsoft and Amazon to battle it out at the end.\nGoogle decided last year not to compete for the contract, saying it would conflict with its AI ethics principles. Google employees have been especially vocal in protesting the company's involvement with government contracts.\n\"It's a paradigm changer for Microsoft to win JEDI,\" said Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities. \"And it's a huge black eye for Amazon and Bezos.\"\nMicrosoft, Amazon, Google and other tech giants have faced criticism from their own employees about doing business with the government, especially on military and immigration related projects.", "URL": "https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/news/world-policy/article/2019/10/26/pentagon-hands-microsoft-10b-deal"}, {"Title": "The AI Eye: AWS (NASDAQ: $AMZN) Launches Middle East Region, Oracle (NYSE: $ORCL) Named Leader for Multiexperience Development Platform and VMware (NYSE: $VMW) Extends Strategic Partnership with Google Cloud", "Text": "Today's Column The AI Eye Watching stock news, deal tracker and advancements in artificial intelligence Stocks discussed: (NasdaqGS:AMZN) (NYSE:ORCL) (NYSE:VMW)\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), a subsidiary of Amazon ( NasdaqGS:AMZN ), has announced the launch of a new Middle East region based in Bahrain.

Traffic management, shipping, and logistics are among the areas with the most potential to be improved by artificial intelligence. Waymo is ahead of competitors in cracking autonomous vehicles, having logged 10 million miles with self driving cars since October 2018. This article includes an overview of AI in transportation, including the top three trends to watch, and how advances in smart vehicles are pushing the need for better infrastructure solutions. Read how AI is transforming health, retail, consumer technology, and more in other articles from our special report, How AI is Changing Everything. Opportunities abound in the world of smart, internet connected transportation infrastructure. This is the next frontier in intelligent systems design that touches every level of urban life: from the roads on which we drive, to the way we move around our cities and neighborhoods. The paradigm shift is already happening, albeit in ways that might not be obvious. Sensors embedded in roadways can communicate with signaling systems to optimize traffic flow. Parking structures can send information about space availability to an app on your smartphone. And eventually, roads will be able to communicate more directly with autonomous vehicles and traffic signals in tandem, thereby reducing the friction caused by unpredictable human drivers. But there is much further to go, and the current state of existing roads, bridges, railways, and other infrastructure in the US has lagged far behind the technology that futurists envision will power modern cities. The biggest metropolises in the US Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago contain an amalgam of the old and the new, adding further complexity to the task of modernization. \"We have to bring our infrastructure back up to standard before we can even consider modernizing for the future,\" Professor Lucio Soibelman, chair of the civil and environmental engineering department at the University of Southern California, said in an interview with Business Insider. \"So many of our roads, tunnels, and bridges in the US are in such poor condition, they can barely serve our current needs today.\" The American Society of Civil Engineers seems to agree with Soibelman. It gave America's infrastructure a D+ in its 2017 report card , the most recent scoring of the nation's infrastructure, which includes bridges, dams, hazardous waste, public parks, ports, roads, transit, and more. In order to realize the full potential of transportation infrastructure driven by artificial intelligence, those technologies must be integrated during the planning stages. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley's Institute of Transportation Studies find that three key infrastructure improvements are necessary to facilitate that process, among them: sensors that help connected vehicles talk to signaling devices. \"These will enable two way communication between the vehicles and traffic management systems so that they can maximize safety, efficiency, and traffic flow,\" they said in a comprehensive 2017 report on intelligent transportation systems and infrastructure. Architects, civil and software engineers, and local legislators have to provide the expertise and funding to ensure the buildings, roads, and bridges that crisscross our cities are equipped for such a future. The top 3 opportunities for AI in transportation Self driving vehicles: Nascent As noted by Ayoub Aouad, a Business Insider Intelligence senior research analyst, this segment is poised to be \"the biggest opportunity AI creates in the transportation space,\" to the tune of $556 billion by 2026, expanding at a 39% compound annual growth rate from $54 billion in 2019, according to Allied Market Research. Silicon Valley has stepped up here, with Waymo, Mobileye, Uber, Tesla, other companies forging ahead. Signaling and traffic monitoring: Growing The autobahn system in Austria relies on a connected roadways system developed by Cisco , which connects more than 6,000 traffic cameras and tens of thousands of sensors to help monitor traffic and road conditions, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers notes in its own roundup on the ways in which the Internet of Things will unify roadways and traffic signals. Electronically regulated toll road systems serve a similar function in major cities in the US. These lanes could eventually be designated for autonomous vehicles or robo taxis. Shipping and logistics: Growing This sector is moving quickly thanks in part to rapid expansion in e commerce led by companies like Amazon. To that end, tech giants like Oracle are helping companies find the most cost effective way to ship goods, Business Insider's Rachel Premack reported recently. The Oracle Logistics Cloud product uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to pair long distance truckers with companies that need a driver to transport goods. Connected vehicles are helping to accelerate the shift toward smart infrastructure These vehicles are already roaming streets and highways in large numbers, guided by satellite navigation, and equipped with intelligent systems that allow the vehicle to sense its immediate surroundings to assist drivers and help prevent collisions. The endgame is for these cars to drive themselves, with no human intervention. But that costs a lot of time and money. Waymo, Alphabet's self driving vehicle unit, is way ahead, having logged 10 million (seven zeros) miles with its autonomous cars as of October 2018. Its vehicle fleet covered that distance in 25 cities across several cities in the US. In terms of miles driven in its own computer simulations has logged 10 billion virtual miles. The company's significant investment in autonomy has some Wall Street analysts projecting massive valuations for the business. In December 2018, Jefferies raised its long term value estimate for Waymo to $250 billion. Waymo has sought partners in its effort to bring autonomous vehicles \u2014 in the form of robo taxis \u2014 to market. It partnered with Lyft in May, delivering ten of its vehicles to be used on the ride hailing company's platform in Phoenix, Arizona. Vivek Wadhwa and Alex Salkever, who co wrote the 2017 book, \"The Driver in the Driverless Car\" say it makes sense that the self driving automobile would spur innovation in infrastructure, and eventually change the landscape in the US. \"We will no longer need traffic lights: robot cars will synchronize wirelessly to time mass movements across city intersections and entries onto freeways or balletic dances around four way stop signs.\" \"When all the driverless cars are talking to each other, there will be no need for them to ever come to a complete halt and waste all their kinetic energy.\" The proliferation of railways and highways had a similar effect during the second industrial revolution in the 20th century. Indeed, connected cars, and eventually self driving vehicles, by virtue of being the primary beneficiaries of intelligent city design, are bound to do it again.

up to interconnect clouds \u2013 with retail customers cited", "Text": "05 June 2019, 15:03 p.m. comment Industry , Infrastructure , Microsoft , Software Here's proof that cloudy collaboration can happen even at the highest levels: Microsoft and Oracle have announced an 'interoperability partnership' aimed at helping customers migrate and run mission critical enterprise workloads across Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud. Organisations who are customers of both vendors will be able to connect Azure and Oracle Cloud seamlessly. The Oracle Ashburn data centre and the Azure US East facilities are the only ones available for connection at this stage, however both companies have plans to expand to additional regions. The two companies will also offer unified identity and access management to manage resources across Azure and Oracle Cloud, while Oracle's enterprise applications, such as JD Edwards EnterpriseOne and Hyperion, can be deployed on Azure with Oracle databases running in Oracle's cloud. \"As the cloud of choice for the enterprise, with over 95% of the Fortune 500 using Azure, we have always been first and foremost focused on helping our customers thrive on their digital transformation journeys,\" said Scott Guthrie, executive vice president for Microsoft's cloud and AI division in a statement. \"With Oracle's enterprise expertise, this alliance is a natural choice for us as we help our joint customers accelerate the migration of enterprise applications and databases to the public cloud.\" This move may be seen as a surprise to some who may see Microsoft and Oracle as competitors in public cloud, but it is by no means the most surprising \u2013 that honour still goes to Oracle and Salesforce's doomed romance in 2013 \u2013 cloud partnership. Indeed, the rationale is a potentially interesting one. The press materials gave mention to three customers. Aside from energy supplier Halliburton, the other two \u2013 Albertsons and Gap Inc \u2013 are worth considering. Albertsons, as regular readers of this publication will know , moved over to Microsoft earlier this year. At the time, CIO Anuj Dhanda told CNBC the company went with Azure because of its 'experience with big companies, history with large retailers and strong technical capabilities, and because it [wasn't] a competitor.' Gap was announced as a Microsoft customer in a five year deal back in November. Again speaking with CNBC \u2013 and as reported by CIO Dive \u2013 Shelley Branston, Microsoft corporate VP for global retail and consumer goods, said retailers shied away from Amazon Web Services (AWS) because they want 'a partner that is not going to be a competitor of theirs in any other parts of their businesses.' Albertsons said in a statement that the Microsoft/Oracle alliance would allow the company 'to create cross cloud solutions that optimise many current investments while maximising the agility, scalability and efficiency of the public cloud', while Gap noted the move would help 'bring [its] omnichannel experience closer together and transform the technology platform that powers the Gap Inc. brands'. Yet it's worth noting that the retail cloud 'war' may be a little overplayed. Following the Albertsons move Jean Atelsek, digital economics unit analyst at 451 Research, told CloudTech : \"It's easy to get the impression that retailers are fleeing AWS. Microsoft's big partnership with Walmart seems to be the example that everyone wants to universalise the entire cloud space. However since a lot of retailers also sell through/on AWS, they're less likely than Walmart to see Amazon (and by extension AWS) as the devil.\"", "URL": "http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2019/jun/05/microsoft-and-oracle-partner-interconnect-clouds-retail-customers-cited/"}]}, {"client": "STATE OF MISSOURI | GB000D37", "industry": "Education", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 9.0, "market": "US", "products": "Oracle Enterprise Manager, Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse, Oracle Cloud Platform", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "SALESFORCE.

The company on Tuesday also announced that the bot will integrate with Microsoft's work stream collaboration platform, Teams.\nOracle's Digital Assistant was launched last year as an interface to its portfolio of enterprise software applications, which includes sales, marketing and human resource tools. The virtual assistant uses AI techniques such as machine learning and natural language processing and understanding to interpret user intent; it's designed to automate processes such as expense approvals and meeting re schedules. [ Related: How AI is changing office suites ]\nThe Digital Assistant was initially targeted at text interactions and embedded in various communication and collaboration tools such as Slack, WeChat and Facebook Messenger, as well as user websites and as a standalone mobile app. The most common use cases so far have been customer service interactions, employee self service for IT help desk issues, and interactions with Oracle's enterprise resource planning systems, such as invoices, the company said.\nThe addition of a voice interface should broaden the appeal of the virtual assistant, said Suhas Uliyar, Oracle's vice president of AI and Oracle Digital Assistant. \"One of the things we are beginning to see in the field or have received feedback from customers on is the rise of voice in the enterprise,\" he said. \"People want to be able to speak to the chatbot or virtual assistant rather than type or tap.\"\nVoice assistants have proven popular with users at home and have begun to spread into the workplace; Amazon's Alexa for Business service is a prime example. Although adoption rates are still low, analyst firm Gartner forecast that 25% of digital workers will interact with voice assistants on a daily basis within two years. Why build another voice assistant?\nOracle's Digital Assistant already interacts with other voice assistants, including Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. Uliyar cited two key reasons the company is adding its own voice capabilities \u2013 namely a lack of support for business vocabulary and privacy concerns in relation to other AI based options.\nApple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft have each come under fire after reports that staff and contract workers have been given access to small numbers of customer voice recordings for quality review. Amazon, Google and Microsoft have defended the practice.\nUliyar stressed that customer data will not be accessed by Oracle employees.\n\"Customers don't want their data going to public cloud vendors, or, more specifically, being accessed or listened to by third party vendors,\" he said. \"In our instance, the privacy and security is maintained. Only our customers have access to their data. We don't use it to retrain our models: that's very important for GDPR. And while we store it in the Oracle second generation cloud infrastructure, we at Oracle don't touch it. Privacy, security and compliance with GDPR is very important.\"\nUliyar also said Oracle was able to tailor its Digital Assistant to the language used in the workplace and add acronyms or terms common in individual sectors into the voice assistant's lexicon.\nTake \"KAD,\" for example, which in the parlance of Oracle's employees refers to \"key account director.\" This is liable to be taken as a reference to a 'cat' or \"CAD,\" the abbreviation for Canadian dollars, by more consumer focused AI assistants, said Uliyar.\nAnother feature is the option to receive text responses to spoken questions, which helps address the challenges of voice assistant interactions in a busy office, Oracle said.\nUsing a voice assistant in the workplace can raise data protection concerns if sensitive data is broadcast for other employees to hear, while the noise can be a distraction.\n\"For example, you may be in an office where there are cubicles everywhere,\" said Uliyar. \"Imagine the chaos if everyone's digital assistant spoke back to you. Even at a low volume that would be a lot. You can turn it off, you can just speak to the digital assistant and you can get the data back in text.\"\nBy delivering text responses, voice assistants should be no more disruptive than an employee taking a phone call. \"Users want to be able to speak what comes in their mind and if they can get an answer back as text they love that because now they are not disturbing anyone,\" Uliyer said.\nJim Lundy, founder and CEO at Aragon Research, called Oracle's OpenWorld demo of the assistant's ability to file an expense report \"solid\" and he anticipates interest among enterprises in new ways of interacting with cloud apps.\n\"Being able to talk to an enterprise app is a big deal \u2013 we see growing demand for Q&A bots and ones that do tasks for you,\" he said. \"The biggest issue Oracle faces is that it is mainly selling its Digital Assistant to existing Oracle Customers. There are many firms looking for chatbots that solve fundamental questions and answers \u2013 Oracle needs to make it easier for those firms to acquire Oracle Digital Assistant offerings. Note, the Microsoft Teams deal should help.\"\nEven so, questions have been raised over Oracle's ability to deliver a voice assistant. One analyst warned users of Oracle's lack of expertise with voice AI technologies and suggested it would be better to partner with another vendor with more experience.\n\"Customers should be very skeptical before deploying Oracle's Digital Assistant,\" said Patrick Moorhead, founder and president of Moor Insights & Strategy. \"The company has no track record in AI, particularly natural language speech and cognition. I would feel a lot more comfortable if Oracle had partnered with companies like Microsoft or Amazon that have leadership capabilities in voice.\" Microsoft Teams integration\nAs for the AI's assistant integration with Microsoft Teams, Oracle said it enables workers to interact with Oracle's human capital management or sales applications without leaving Teams. This will save users time and avoiding the need to switch between apps, Oracle said.\n\"Now, as an employee I don't need to go to 10 different places to find my answer, I use the same tool [for team collaboration] to now chat with my sales backend or ERP backend and get the answer,\" said Uliyar.\nThe decision to integrate with Microsoft's application makes sense as the two companies continue to work together, Lundy said. \"Since many Oracle accounts are also Microsoft Office 365 accounts, this is a solid move,\" he said.\n\"Overall, there seems to be more cooperation between Microsoft and Oracle \u2013 most likely to thwart the growing threat from Amazon AWS. We expect that this will create demand for Oracle customers \u2013 to the extent that Oracle can demonstrate more integrations with other applications \u2013 that should make Oracle Digital Assistant more sticky in non Oracle accounts.\"\nThe Teams integration is currently available as a private preview.", "URL": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/3439437/oracle-launches-ai-voice-assistant-for-its-business-app-suite.html"}, {"Title": "Microsoft, Oracle Partner For Cloud Push At AWS", "Text": "All Tech News > Cloud > Cloud Management > Microsoft, Oracle Partner For Cloud Push At AWS Microsoft, Oracle Partner For Cloud Push At AWS Twitter\nOne time bitter rivals Microsoft and Oracle agree to make their cloud services work together\nMicrosoft and Oracle have reached an interoperability agreement that they hope will pose a stiff challenge to the all mighty Amazon and its AWS cloud service.\nRedmond and Oracle agreed to make their two cloud computing services work together, with high speed links between their respective data centres.\nEssentially the partnership should help businesses that want to migrate and run mission critical enterprise workloads across either Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud.

In fact, it's probably hard to find a company that isn't using some mix of Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, IBM Cloud, Salesforce.com, Oracle, Google G Suite, ServiceNow or Box. The list goes on and on. This is more pronounced with enterprises that have a global site footprint.\nThe cloud, after all, gets you out of the business of hosting applications and worrying about upgrading hardware and software constantly. It also enables you to sidestep the capital commitments otherwise required.\nHowever, the more clouds you use, the more complex connectivity becomes. Security concerns skyrocket as it becomes hard to figure out who is accessing what, from where and how. In addition, the network becomes central to application performance across the organization. Forces at work\nDespite the network challenges multi cloud creates, multi cloud is here to stay and will become even more complex with time as: Companies turn to even more SaaS offerings that enable them to embrace best of breed rather than multi purpose on premise solution bundles that have to meet various requirements of legacy environments Technologies, such as serverless computing and other advances, that are only possible with cloud native applications attract more enterprise workloads Adoption of Internet of Things technologies and strategies require organizations to collect and analyze data closer to scattered sensors at the edge of the network, probably in specialized cloud services Companies try to mesh cloud tools with on premises systems in hybrid configurations because stringent security or compliance requirements or the tightly integrated nature of those legacy systems prevents going all in with cloud\nUnfortunately, this shifting, demanding and dynamic environment is not a good fit for the 20 year old legacy MPLS wide area networks that many organizations still rely on. Besides the fact that MPLS simply can't provide off ramps to many cloud tools, adding bandwidth is expensive and simple network changes can take months. It's like trying to erect a shiny new skyscraper on a stone foundation fit for a mountain cabin. Businesses are short changed on time to market and this is a big no for CxOs driving WAN transformation initiatives.\nThe good news is software defined WANs promise agility and enable enterprises to realize the full potential of what multi cloud environments have to offer. But traditional SD WANs don't own the network and have to partner with telcos and service providers that do, creating a suboptimal solution. This is where a fully managed SD WAN solution, where the provider owns both the network and the software definition provides the \"best of both worlds.\"\nA fully managed SD WAN running on a private network can connect far flung employees to various data centre resources while also providing direct connections to public cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, Google and Oracle as well as connectivity to SaaS platforms such as Office 365, Salesforce, WebEx and Zoom, without compromising on application performance.\nA managed SD WAN allows enterprises to shift higher value human resources from the business of assessing technology, building out the network and then constantly tweaking and optimizing it as requirements change. Patching edge routers or boxes from traditional, SD WAN vendors is often an operational nightmare.\nWhen managed SD WAN is delivered as a service, it is akin to a SaaS provider, delivering connectivity as a service.\nWhile SD WAN services can help any organization deliver consistent application performance to employees around the world, the benefits for IT are magnified in multi cloud environments because they get a unified view that is cloud provider agnostic.\nHowever, not all managed SD WAN services are alike. Speed of provisioning new circuits, the reliability of the backbone, the quality of the support and ease of engagement \u2013 all make a huge difference! Look for a fully managed SD WAN that leverages a private network for the middle mile, uses built in acceleration and optimization tools to improve application performance, and uses best of breed layered security from partners for mission critical applications.\nSo, when it comes to looking for an SD WAN delivered as a service to support growing multi cloud needs, look for: A simple, managed global solution for multi cloud connectivity End to end reliability SLAs guaranteeing 99.99% uptime 24x7x365 monitoring and CCIE level support Built in WAN acceleration and optimisation, regardless of the cloud resource targeted Off ramps to all the cloud providers Deployment capabilities measured in hours at any site globally Support for on demand site and bandwidth changes\nCIOs invest considerably in their public and multi cloud strategy. The productivity of developers and corporate applications is compromised, if the underlying network connectivity is flaky or if it takes too long for a predictable site connection to be up and running. Digital transformation and the move to the cloud should start with the network. That is ground zero for a multi cloud world.

services threaten operators\u2019 position as retail providers", "Text": "Alternative models for the delivery of SD WAN services threaten operators' position as retail providers 9 October 2019 | PDF (2 pages) Content type: Article Research programme: Catherine Hammond Principal Analyst, Research\n\"Operators continue to control key customer relationships for business connectivity services, but these may be eroded over time as SD WAN providers develop alternative routes to market.\"\nOperators are an important route to market for many SD WAN technology providers. Operators command a strong position in the market due to their existing customer relationships and ability to provide end to end managed services that include the underlying local access and backbone networks. However, technology providers are also developing alternative routes to market, often with new models for delivery and more aggressive or innovative pricing. This article outlines the threats posed to operators by these alternative delivery models, and argues that operators must deliver effective SD WAN solutions of their own, with good levels of customer satisfaction, in order to defend their connectivity revenue.\nThis article draws on our recent report, SD WAN technology providers (volume II): nine case studies and analysis , which provides a more detailed assessment of many of the SD WAN technology providers, including Citrix, Fortinet, Oracle and Silver Peak. 1 A growing number of SD WAN vendors are looking to operators as an important route to market\nA significant number of SD WAN vendors (including Nokia/Nuage Networks, Versa and VMware) have built their go to market strategies around partnerships with operators; Cisco also relies heavily upon this channel. Other players such as Fortinet, Oracle and Silver Peak are also developing relationships with operators in order to extend their market shares as the SD WAN market grows, and as the emphasis shifts to managed SD WAN rather than DIY deployments.\nMost major network operators have already selected SD WAN partners, but some vendors have ambitions to become an additional supplier. Silver Peak, for example, has recently become an SD WAN provider to Verizon, alongside Cisco (Viptela) and Versa. Others are targeting smaller operators that have not yet launched SD WAN, or are seeking to provide SD WAN solutions that deliver against certain criteria such as low costs for the SME market (for example, Ekinops) or high levels of application intelligence (for example, Infovista). Vendors seeking to gain market share via alternative routes to market could pose a significant threat to operators\nMany SD WAN technology providers sell services either directly to enterprises or via alternatives to operator channels such as systems integrators (SIs), managed service providers (MSPs), network integrators and resellers. The Master Agent channel is also an important route for many providers in the USA. Some technology providers (such as Aryaka and Cato Networks) consider themselves to be direct competitors to operators.\nWe have identified a number of threats to operators' SD WAN services (and to their business connectivity services more generally) that may come about as a result of these players' strategies. The use of the MSP channel is likely to grow strongly. Many of the vendors that we interviewed highlighted the MSP channel as being important. We believe that this channel poses a significant threat to operators, particularly if MSPs are also able to manage the underlying local access networks. There is a growing emphasis on managed SD WAN rather than DIY deployments in both North America and across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia. Operators are well placed to meet this change in emphasis, but MSPs can also deliver managed SD WAN services. Many vendors additionally partner with SIs to meet enterprise requirements for managed SD WAN services. Procurement may become more application focused and less network focused. Many SD WAN technology providers (especially those selling independently of operators, such as Citrix and CloudGenix) emphasise their relationships with application providers (such as Ring Central and Salesforces, as well as hyperscale cloud providers) rather than network providers. The customer relationship with network operators remains valuable, but procurement is likely to become increasingly application led, and pricing and SLAs will be based on application performance rather than bandwidth provisioned. This has the potential to disrupt traditional customer relationships. The provision of global backbone connectivity is increasing. Several SD WAN vendors, including Aryaka and Cato Networks, operate private backbone networks to avoid routing international traffic via the internet. Procuring backbone services from data centre players such as Equinix is also becoming more common. This threatens operators' ability to differentiate their SD WAN services to international businesses on the basis of global backbone connectivity.\nIn addition, the sheer range of alternative models being explored is itself a threat. Lots of non operator models are being experimented with. These include those based around security (Fortinet) or applications (Citrix), and those that emphasise cost savings by dropping MPLS (Aryaka and Cato Networks). In contrast, most operators rely on a single, network integrated model for SD WAN. It is not clear which of the alternative models might emerge as winners. However, from the weight of experimentation, it is likely that some models may emerge with clear advantages that operators will struggle to counter. Operators must ensure that they deliver effective SD WAN solutions of their own\nAt present, operators continue to control key customer relationships and access to established sales channels. Their ability to deliver end to end managed services that integrate the underlying local access and backbone networks with SD WAN and legacy connectivity services remains an important consideration for many technology providers and businesses alike.\nBusiness customers that are reasonably satisfied with the services received from their current supplier are unlikely to switch to an alternative provider without good reason. Surveys consistently report that most businesses are very cautious about switching their fixed supplier. However, if operators fail to deliver good levels of customer satisfaction, they risk losing a significant share of the retail business connectivity markets.", "URL": "https://www.analysysmason.com/Research/Content/Comments/sdwan-vendor-strategies-ren01/"}, {"Title": "Layoffs, Top Channel Chiefs and SD-WAN Leaders: Your Week in Channel", "Text": "Written by James Anderson 3 hours ago Pax8 drew an influential master agent executive to its team, and VMware scored another big SD WAN recognition this week.\nOur latest weekly wrap contains a mix of personnel announcements, market research, industry awards, M&A rumors and layoffs.

Operators command a strong position in the market due to their existing customer relationships and ability to provide end to end managed services that include the underlying local access and backbone networks. However, technology providers are also developing alternative routes to market, often with new models for delivery and more aggressive or innovative pricing. This article outlines the threats posed to operators by these alternative delivery models, and argues that operators must deliver effective SD WAN solutions of their own, with good levels of customer satisfaction, in order to defend their connectivity revenue.\nThis article draws on our recent report, SD WAN technology providers (volume II): nine case studies and analysis , which provides a more detailed assessment of many of the SD WAN technology providers, including Citrix, Fortinet, Oracle and Silver Peak. 1 A growing number of SD WAN vendors are looking to operators as an important route to market\nA significant number of SD WAN vendors (including Nokia/Nuage Networks, Versa and VMware) have built their go to market strategies around partnerships with operators; Cisco also relies heavily upon this channel. Other players such as Fortinet, Oracle and Silver Peak are also developing relationships with operators in order to extend their market shares as the SD WAN market grows, and as the emphasis shifts to managed SD WAN rather than DIY deployments.\nMost major network operators have already selected SD WAN partners, but some vendors have ambitions to become an additional supplier. Silver Peak, for example, has recently become an SD WAN provider to Verizon, alongside Cisco (Viptela) and Versa. Others are targeting smaller operators that have not yet launched SD WAN, or are seeking to provide SD WAN solutions that deliver against certain criteria such as low costs for the SME market (for example, Ekinops) or high levels of application intelligence (for example, Infovista). Vendors seeking to gain market share via alternative routes to market could pose a significant threat to operators\nMany SD WAN technology providers sell services either directly to enterprises or via alternatives to operator channels such as systems integrators (SIs), managed service providers (MSPs), network integrators and resellers. The Master Agent channel is also an important route for many providers in the USA. Some technology providers (such as Aryaka and Cato Networks) consider themselves to be direct competitors to operators.\nWe have identified a number of threats to operators' SD WAN services (and to their business connectivity services more generally) that may come about as a result of these players' strategies. The use of the MSP channel is likely to grow strongly. Many of the vendors that we interviewed highlighted the MSP channel as being important. We believe that this channel poses a significant threat to operators, particularly if MSPs are also able to manage the underlying local access networks. There is a growing emphasis on managed SD WAN rather than DIY deployments in both North America and across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia. Operators are well placed to meet this change in emphasis, but MSPs can also deliver managed SD WAN services. Many vendors additionally partner with SIs to meet enterprise requirements for managed SD WAN services. Procurement may become more application focused and less network focused. Many SD WAN technology providers (especially those selling independently of operators, such as Citrix and CloudGenix) emphasise their relationships with application providers (such as Ring Central and Salesforces, as well as hyperscale cloud providers) rather than network providers. The customer relationship with network operators remains valuable, but procurement is likely to become increasingly application led, and pricing and SLAs will be based on application performance rather than bandwidth provisioned. This has the potential to disrupt traditional customer relationships. The provision of global backbone connectivity is increasing. Several SD WAN vendors, including Aryaka and Cato Networks, operate private backbone networks to avoid routing international traffic via the internet. Procuring backbone services from data centre players such as Equinix is also becoming more common. This threatens operators' ability to differentiate their SD WAN services to international businesses on the basis of global backbone connectivity.\nIn addition, the sheer range of alternative models being explored is itself a threat. Lots of non operator models are being experimented with. These include those based around security (Fortinet) or applications (Citrix), and those that emphasise cost savings by dropping MPLS (Aryaka and Cato Networks). In contrast, most operators rely on a single, network integrated model for SD WAN. It is not clear which of the alternative models might emerge as winners. However, from the weight of experimentation, it is likely that some models may emerge with clear advantages that operators will struggle to counter. Operators must ensure that they deliver effective SD WAN solutions of their own\nAt present, operators continue to control key customer relationships and access to established sales channels. Their ability to deliver end to end managed services that integrate the underlying local access and backbone networks with SD WAN and legacy connectivity services remains an important consideration for many technology providers and businesses alike.\nBusiness customers that are reasonably satisfied with the services received from their current supplier are unlikely to switch to an alternative provider without good reason.

Volkswagen - 5 Things You Must Know", "Text": "Mar15,20197:49AMEDT TS Illustration/JOHANNES EISELE/AFP/Getty\nHere are five things you must know for Friday, March 15: 1. Stocks Rise as U.S. and China Make Trade Progress\nU.S. stock futures were higher on Friday, getting a lift from Asian markets that rose on hopes the U.S. and China were making progress on a trade agreement. Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 125 points, futures for the S&P 500 were up 13.25 points, and Nasdaq futures gained 44.50 points. Chinese state media reported Friday that Washington and Beijing made \"concrete progress\" on the text of their trade pact.\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke by telephone with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, according to the Xinhua news agency.\nDonald Trump said Thursday the U.S. would know where the trade agreement stood over the next three to four weeks. \"We'll have news on China. Probably one way or the other, we're going to know over the next three to four weeks,\" Trump said during a St. Patrick's Day reception at the White House. China has been \"very responsible and very reasonable,\" the president said. Stocks in the U.S. closed Thursday's session mixed , with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finishing slightly lower and putting an end to three day winning streaks. Boeing ( BA ) dipped in premarket trading Friday after the aircraft manufacturer said it would temporarily halt deliveries of new 737 MAX jets. The company said it paused delivery of the planes to clients after the model crashed for the second time since October. The U.S. on Wednesday became the last major country to ground the 737 MAX following last Sunday's Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed all 157 aboard.\nThe economic calendar in the U.S. Friday includes the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for March at 8:30 a.m. ET, Industrial Production for February at 9:15 a.m., Consumer Sentiment for March at 10 a.m., and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for January at 10 a.m. 2. Tesla's Model Y to Be Released in 2020 With Starting Price of $47,000\nTesla ( TSLA ) took the wraps off its Model Y sport utility vehicle, rounding out its full lineup of electric cars.\nCEO Elon Musk introduced the new crossover, a mid sized SUV that's larger than the entry level Model 3 but smaller than the Model X, Tesla's full size SUV at an event Thursday at the company's design studio in Hawthorne, Calif.\nThe first Model Y models are due for release in fall 2020, and slated to start at $47,000 for the long range version. A dual motor, all wheel drive version will be available for $51,000, and a sportier performance version will sell for $60,000. The following year a \"standard range\" version will arrive and start at $39,000, Musk said.\nThe versions will vary in range, speed and power: The long range one will run up to a distance of 300 miles, while the standard range version will run for 230 miles on a charge.\nThe Model Y will seat seven passengers, and have 65 cubic feet of cargo space. The performance version will be able to go from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds.\nCompleting the EV lineup that Musk has dubbed \"S3XY,\" the Model Y has the \"functionality of an SUV but will ride like a sports car.\"\n\"We expect it will be the safest mid size SUV in the world by far,\" Musk said at the event.\nShares of Tesla fell 2.8% in premarket trading to $281.82. 3. Facebook Loses Two Top Executives\nFacebook ( FB ) said Chief Product Officer Chris Cox and Chris Daniels, who ran the business development team and WhatsApp, will be leaving as CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated the social media giant's new focus on being a \"privacy focused social platform.\"\n\"At this point, we have made real progress on many issues and we have a clear plan for our apps, centered around making private messaging, stories and groups the foundation of the experience, including enabling encryption and interoperability across our services,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"As we embark on this next major chapter, (Cox) has decided now is the time to step back from leading these teams.\"\nCox played an integral role in Facebook's development, starting as an engineer on the original News Feed, building its first HR teams, leading product and design teams, running the Facebook app, and most recently determining strategy for the company's family of apps, according to Zuckerberg's post.\nCox was seen as a potential successor to Zuckerberg.\n\"This will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through,\" Cox wrote in a statement.

Virtualization has become an integral part of many organizations' infrastructure. Most of the services and data are hosted on the cloud, which has brought about more flexibility in the way organizations handle their services and data. However, with this change, there came a big challenge: the challenge of network compatibility. The traditional network was not compatible with the cloud and this was because it was dispersed, decentralized, and relied on a lot of equipment that had to be manually administered. Simply put, traditional networking strategy doesn't cut it anymore. This is when the organizations turned to a faster, more stable, and more reliable networking solution \u2014 software defined wide area networks , or SD WAN.\nSD WAN has been a hot topic in recent years and rightfully so. Instead of relying on regional offices, expensive equipment, and manual administration, this networking strategy empowers organizations to work with the new age of computing. SD WAN provides a centralized view of an organization's network. It connects the services directly to the internet which helps remove bottlenecks. SD WAN also allows you to choose the ISP of your own choice based on your budget and location and it also allows for a combination of ISPs to be used together to help boost the performance. With SD WAN, organizations can set up multiple links between different locations that may have separate ISPs, making for a more resilient network that doesn't slow down or stop when a link is down for some reason. And the most important part of this is that an organization doesn't have to invest in expensive equipment anymore.\nHere are some of the SD WAN technologies organizations can count on: Talari Networks SD WAN\nTalari Networks is an SD WAN innovator that was acquired by Oracle back in 2018. Talari Networks' SD WAN solution provides a way to combine private network with the broadband network allowing for a cost effective open enterprise WAN. Talari provides a failsafe, multilink, and multipath networking solution to its users. Talari also offers the feature of smart routing to its users that prioritizes packets based on application requirements. It favors vital applications which it routes through more efficient channels over less important applications which leads to a more efficient networking setup. Talari also provides real time analytics that provides visibility into the network and ways to troubleshoot in case an error occurs. Talari also offers features such as packet replication and continuous measurement of WAN paths for quick and seamless networking. Talari Networks SD WAN centrally manages and distributes policies and services across the network which eliminates manual administration considerably. AireSpring SD WAN\nThis offering helps expand the bandwidth of the entire network considerably by optimizing connectivity. AireSpring SD WAN helps enterprises optimize voice quality over their networks and simplifies WAN management. This solution is easy to deploy and undertakes full management of your organization's network. AireSpring SD WAN provides efficient project management and provides extensive support from its technical specialists. The SD WAN bundle can be customized based on your enterprise needs.

AireSpring also lets enterprises implement custom policies which it ensures are implemented efficiently to avoid any gaps. This solution comes to your door preconfigures based on your specific requirements thereby eliminating the tedious task of installing, configuring, and managing custom policies. Cradlepoint SD WAN\nCradlepoint is a leader in 4G LTE networking. And, with its SD WAN offering, it enables organizations to move away from expensive MPLS by enabling broadband and LTE connectivity. Cradlepoint's NetCloud Manager combined with NetCloud OS available in the organization routers makes for efficient networking infrastructure. It routes the application through channels that are best suited for their particular requirements and specifications. Cradlepoint also analyzes historical data to help with efficient upscaling of the network architecture. NetCloud Manager provides an integrated view of WAN usage that helps network admins to keep a track the usage and manage it efficiently. This also helps in quick detection of issues so that necessary actions can be taken without any delay. NetCloud Manager also helps with threat management and content filtering to ensure security through multipoint VPN. FatPipe Networks\nFatPipe's SD WAN handles connectivity from remote locations without any loss of performance with ease while also speeding up the deployment process considerably. FatPipe makes it easy to deploy appliances through \"zero touch deployment.\" FatPipe provides cloud enabled configuration and cloud hosted management.

Multiple paths make it easy to reroute traffic in case of congestion in the network. FatPipe also gives organizations the liberty to choose the routing architecture that is best suited to their needs. Aryaka SD WAN\nAryaka offers direct and seamless connectivity to web/Saas providers and boosts global acceleration and high productivity even for remote locations. Aryaka is one of the primary disruptors in the SD WAN space. Its SD WAN solution is fully managed, which eliminates the hassle of constant manual intervention by network admins.

Other features Aryaka provides include data compression and deduplication, smart edge, and smart link. My Arkaya is Arkaya's customer portal that helps organizations deal with issues related to connectivity and performance. CloudGenix\nCloudGenix AppFabric lets you choose what kind of WAN transport you want to apply to your branch office. It could be LTE, broadband, or MPLS, based on the demand. CloudGenix ION devices have the capability to automatically set up a reliable and secure connection between different locations while also tracking the usage constantly. CloudGenix AppFabric is self healing, which means that in case of an error, the traffic will be routed through the next best path without manual intervention. AppFabric comes preconfigured with secure and reliable business policies which helps mitigate the task of creating lengthy configuration files and setting them up. CloudGenix helps integrate apps seamlessly irrespective of where they are hosted, which makes for a more efficient network and helps spot and address issues as soon as they appear.\nThe SD WAN market is bustling and newer, more efficient tools and technologies are springing up everywhere. At this point, organizations looking to incorporate SD WAN into their network architecture need to research carefully to find the solution that serves their interests best. This process isn't easy, as an organization that wants to reap the benefits of SD WAN should process a great deal of information about features, pricing, and scalability. This is especially overwhelming when you factor in the pace at which the market grows and innovation takes place. However, it is worth the time and effort when you find a solution that fits your needs and helps you eliminate the cost and provides you with better performance.\nFeatured image: Pexels", "URL": "http://techgenix.com/new-sd-wan-technologies/"}, {"Title": "Tesla, Facebook, Broadcom, Oracle and Volkswagen - 5 Things You Must Know", "Text": "Mar15,20197:49AMEDT TS Illustration/JOHANNES EISELE/AFP/Getty\nHere are five things you must know for Friday, March 15: 1.

channel partner, MSP & CSP news involves Accenture, Coretelligent, Excelero, Flashpoint, Globalgig, Kaseya Unitrends, Kimble, Lenovo, Lifesize, Upland Software, Wasabi & more. by Joe Panettieri Apr 4, 2019\nHere are five technology news updates, insights, chatter, and plenty more to start your day for Thursday, April 4, 2019.\nActually, there are 15 timely updates designed for managed services providers (MSPs), cloud services providers (CSPs), IT consulting firms, systems integrators, VARs, independent software vendors (ISVs), and telco agents to sip on.\n15. Partner Program \u2013 Cloud Storage: Wasabi , a cloud storage company, has launched the Wasabi Partner Network. The program is designed for solution providers, including MSPs, CSPs, system integrators, or anyone offering managed or cloud services, the company says. Wasabi claims to offer enterprise class cloud storage that's one fifth the price and up to six times faster than traditional cloud ventures. The company was founded by former Carbonite CEO David Friend.\n14. Partner Program \u2013 Growth: Flashpoint which specializes in Business Risk Intelligence (BRI), has grown its Global Channel Program 150 percent year over year since its formal introduction in 2017. Also, the company's channel driven revenue has grown more than 200 percent since it signed its first partner in 2015. Revenue from the channel accounted for 45 percent of Flashpoint's revenue in 2018. The anecdotes sound promising, but Flashpoint didn't disclose actual revenue or profit figures from the channel. Growth rates, after all, are hard to place in proper context without those additional figures.\n13. Partnership \u2013 Lenovo & Storage: Lenovo will promote Excelero's NVMesh software defined block storage to customers and channel partners worldwide.\n12. Managed SD WAN Services: Globalgig has launch a managed SD WAN service \u2014 including an advisory practice.\n11. Talent \u2013 Oracle Cloud Executive Departs: Eric Roza, senior VP and GM of Oracle Data Cloud, has resigned to spend more time with his family, according to AdExchanger. Rob Tarkoff, EVP and GM of Oracle CX Cloud, will oversee the Oracle Data Cloud business effective immediately, according to the report. ChannelE2E has not independently confirmed those details.\n10. Video Conferencing \u2013 Growth : Lifesize, the video conferencing equipment specialist, has surpassed $100 million in bookings with an 80 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for annual recurring revenue (ARR) over the last four years, the company says. The company did not disclose actual revenue or profit figures, however.\n9. PSA Software \u2013 Growth: Kimble Applications, a professional services automation (PSA) software provider, ranks among Europe's fastest growing companies, according to Financial Times. Kimble's absolute revenue growth was 280 percent from 2014 to 2018, the company reports. The company is backed by Accel KKR, a technology focused investment firm.\n8. PSA Software \u2013 Upgrade: Upland Software has launched Upland PSA, a professional services automation software platform that augments services automation with proposal automation, voice of the customer and employee surveys, customer reference management, and insights driven business intelligence, the company says. The upgrade also appears to be a rebrand of the former Tenrox PSA platform.\n7. Data Protection: Unitrends has launched new Recovery Series MAX appliances \u2014 three under the Unitrends brand and three under the Unitrends MSP brand. They are specifically designed to handle use cases requiring much more compute power than traditional appliances, Unitrends asserts. Kaseya, which owns Unitrends, has multiple backup, restore and data protection platforms for MSPs. The others include Kaseya Unified Backup and Spanning.\n6. Digital Innovation \u2013 Four Secrets to Success: Accenture reveals them in this research report.\n5. Due Diligence Management: Sterling has launched Sterling GlobalIQ , a cloud based application suite that provides life cycle management of due diligence processes.\n4. M&A \u2013 Legal Managed Services: EY has acquired the Thomson Reuters Pangea3 Legal Managed Services (LMS) business. The deal follows EY's recent acquisition of Riverview Law.\n3. M&A \u2013 WeWork & IT Services: WeWork has acquired Managed by Q \u2014 a platform for hiring office services such as MSPs and IT service providers \n2.

"Mar15,20197:49AMEDT TS Illustration/JOHANNES EISELE/AFP/Getty\nHere are five things you must know for Friday, March 15: 1. Stocks Rise as U.S. and China Make Trade Progress\nU.S. stock futures were higher on Friday, getting a lift from Asian markets that rose on hopes the U.S. and China were making progress on a trade agreement. Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 125 points, futures for the S&P 500 were up 13.25 points, and Nasdaq futures gained 44.50 points. Chinese state media reported Friday that Washington and Beijing made \"concrete progress\" on the text of their trade pact.\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke by telephone with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, according to the Xinhua news agency.\nDonald Trump said Thursday the U.S. would know where the trade agreement stood over the next three to four weeks. \"We'll have news on China. Probably one way or the other, we're going to know over the next three to four weeks,\" Trump said during a St. Patrick's Day reception at the White House. China has been \"very responsible and very reasonable,\" the president said. Stocks in the U.S. closed Thursday's session mixed , with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finishing slightly lower and putting an end to three day winning streaks. Boeing ( BA ) dipped in premarket trading Friday after the aircraft manufacturer said it would temporarily halt deliveries of new 737 MAX jets. The company said it paused delivery of the planes to clients after the model crashed for the second time since October. The U.S. on Wednesday became the last major country to ground the 737 MAX following last Sunday's Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed all 157 aboard.\nThe economic calendar in the U.S. Friday includes the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for March at 8:30 a.m. ET, Industrial Production for February at 9:15 a.m., Consumer Sentiment for March at 10 a.m., and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for January at 10 a.m. 2. Tesla's Model Y to Be Released in 2020 With Starting Price of $47,000\nTesla ( TSLA ) took the wraps off its Model Y sport utility vehicle, rounding out its full lineup of electric cars.\nCEO Elon Musk introduced the new crossover, a mid sized SUV that's larger than the entry level Model 3 but smaller than the Model X, Tesla's full size SUV at an event Thursday at the company's design studio in Hawthorne, Calif.\nThe first Model Y models are due for release in fall 2020, and slated to start at $47,000 for the long range version. A dual motor, all wheel drive version will be available for $51,000, and a sportier performance version will sell for $60,000. The following year a \"standard range\" version will arrive and start at $39,000, Musk said.\nThe versions will vary in range, speed and power: The long range one will run up to a distance of 300 miles, while the standard range version will run for 230 miles on a charge.\nThe Model Y will seat seven passengers, and have 65 cubic feet of cargo space. The performance version will be able to go from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds.\nCompleting the EV lineup that Musk has dubbed \"S3XY,\" the Model Y has the \"functionality of an SUV but will ride like a sports car.\"\n\"We expect it will be the safest mid size SUV in the world by far,\" Musk said at the event.\nShares of Tesla fell 2.8% in premarket trading to $281.82. 3. Facebook Loses Two Top Executives\nFacebook ( FB ) said Chief Product Officer Chris Cox and Chris Daniels, who ran the business development team and WhatsApp, will be leaving as CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated the social media giant's new focus on being a \"privacy focused social platform.\"\n\"At this point, we have made real progress on many issues and we have a clear plan for our apps, centered around making private messaging, stories and groups the foundation of the experience, including enabling encryption and interoperability across our services,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"As we embark on this next major chapter, (Cox) has decided now is the time to step back from leading these teams.\"\nCox played an integral role in Facebook's development, starting as an engineer on the original News Feed, building its first HR teams, leading product and design teams, running the Facebook app, and most recently determining strategy for the company's family of apps, according to Zuckerberg's post.\nCox was seen as a potential successor to Zuckerberg.\n\"This will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through,\" Cox wrote in a statement. Daniels, meanwhile, will be succeeded by Will Cathcart as the head of WhatsApp. Zuckerberg also announced that Fidji Simo will be the new head of the Facebook app as part of a restructuring that will see the CEO take a more direct role following Cox's resignation.

Stocks Rise as U.S. and China Make Trade Progress\nU.S. stock futures were higher on Friday, getting a lift from Asian markets that rose on hopes the U.S. and China were making progress on a trade agreement. Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 125 points, futures for the S&P 500 were up 13.25 points, and Nasdaq futures gained 44.50 points. Chinese state media reported Friday that Washington and Beijing made \"concrete progress\" on the text of their trade pact.\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke by telephone with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, according to the Xinhua news agency.\nDonald Trump said Thursday the U.S. would know where the trade agreement stood over the next three to four weeks. \"We'll have news on China. Probably one way or the other, we're going to know over the next three to four weeks,\" Trump said during a St. Patrick's Day reception at the White House. China has been \"very responsible and very reasonable,\" the president said. Stocks in the U.S. closed Thursday's session mixed , with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finishing slightly lower and putting an end to three day winning streaks. Boeing ( BA ) dipped in premarket trading Friday after the aircraft manufacturer said it would temporarily halt deliveries of new 737 MAX jets. The company said it paused delivery of the planes to clients after the model crashed for the second time since October. The U.S. on Wednesday became the last major country to ground the 737 MAX following last Sunday's Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed all 157 aboard.\nThe economic calendar in the U.S. Friday includes the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for March at 8:30 a.m. ET, Industrial Production for February at 9:15 a.m., Consumer Sentiment for March at 10 a.m., and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for January at 10 a.m. 2.

A dual motor, all wheel drive version will be available for $51,000, and a sportier performance version will sell for $60,000. The following year a \"standard range\" version will arrive and start at $39,000, Musk said.\nThe versions will vary in range, speed and power: The long range one will run up to a distance of 300 miles, while the standard range version will run for 230 miles on a charge.\nThe Model Y will seat seven passengers, and have 65 cubic feet of cargo space. The performance version will be able to go from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds.\nCompleting the EV lineup that Musk has dubbed \"S3XY,\" the Model Y has the \"functionality of an SUV but will ride like a sports car.\"\n\"We expect it will be the safest mid size SUV in the world by far,\" Musk said at the event.\nShares of Tesla fell 2.8% in premarket trading to $281.82. 3. Facebook Loses Two Top Executives\nFacebook ( FB ) said Chief Product Officer Chris Cox and Chris Daniels, who ran the business development team and WhatsApp, will be leaving as CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated the social media giant's new focus on being a \"privacy focused social platform.\"\n\"At this point, we have made real progress on many issues and we have a clear plan for our apps, centered around making private messaging, stories and groups the foundation of the experience, including enabling encryption and interoperability across our services,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"As we embark on this next major chapter, (Cox) has decided now is the time to step back from leading these teams.\"\nCox played an integral role in Facebook's development, starting as an engineer on the original News Feed, building its first HR teams, leading product and design teams, running the Facebook app, and most recently determining strategy for the company's family of apps, according to Zuckerberg's post.\nCox was seen as a potential successor to Zuckerberg.\n\"This will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through,\" Cox wrote in a statement. Daniels, meanwhile, will be succeeded by Will Cathcart as the head of WhatsApp. Zuckerberg also announced that Fidji Simo will be the new head of the Facebook app as part of a restructuring that will see the CEO take a more direct role following Cox's resignation.

Broadcom Jumps After a Big Earnings Beat\nBroadcom ( AVGO ) rose 4.8% in after hours trading Thursday after posting stronger than expected fiscal first quarter earnings and saying it would return around $12 billion to stockholders this year through dividends and stock buybacks.\nEarnings in the quarter were $5.55 a share, well ahead of the Wall Street forecast of $5.22. Net revenue was $5.79 billion, just shy of the consensus forecast of $5.82 billion.\nFree cash flow rose 39% from last year to more than $2 billion, Broadcom said. The semiconductor company said it expects \"returning approximately $12 billion to stockholders in fiscal 2019 via a combination of cash dividends and stock buybacks and eliminations, while maintaining our investment grade credit rating.\"\n\"We had a good start to 2019 as we continued to execute on our proven business model. Strong results in our networking business supported our semiconductor solutions segment, despite the anticipated sharp decline in wireless,\" said CEO Hock Tan. \"Additionally, our infrastructure software segment performed extremely well as we made good progress with the CA business integration into Broadcom.\"\n\"Similar to our peers, we see a slowdown in China impacting demand,\" Tan added. \"However, much of this was factored into our original guidance and we are maintaining our full year fiscal 2019 business outlook.\" Broadcom Gains Following an Earnings Beat: 5 Key Takeaways\nOther news from the tech sector:\nAdobe ( ADBE ) fell 3.3% in premarket trading Friday after the cloud based software company issued fiscal second quarter guidance below analysts' expectations.\nOracle ( ORCL ) fell 3.6% in premarket trading after the software giant reported fiscal third quarter adjusted earnings of 87 cents a share , beating forecasts by 3 cents, but issued a fourth quarter outlook that disappointed investors. 5. SEC Accuses Volkswagen of 'Massive Fraud' in Dieselgate Scandal\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has sued Volkswagen ( VLKAY ) , alleging in a court filing that the German automaker \"perpetrated a massive fraud\" during its diesel emissions scandal.\nVolkswagen and former CEO Martin Winterkorn fraudulently raised billions of dollars from investors, including by overplaying the firm's environmental credentials.\nVolkswagen earlier this week said it plans to cut between 5,000 to 7,000 jobs by 2023 as the company shifts its focus to electric vehicles.\nThe move also is aimed at cutting operating costs by about \u20ac5.9 billion ($6.6 billion). Volkswagen is expected to invest a total of $19 billion over the next five years to make electric vehicles, moving away from gas powered engines in the wake of the so called dieselgate scandal that has cost the company $30 billion. ** How Much Money Will I Need to Retire?\nWant to learn about retirement planning from some of the nation's top experts?

in SA-first partnership with global product feeds specialist, Feedonomics - incuBeta", "Text": "IncuBeta Group, through its specialist digital marketing agency, NMPi, has launched a shopping feeds optimisation service together with global product feeds platform specialist, Feedonomics. The partnership, the first of its kind in the South African market, will allow NMPi to offer both its local and global clients an optimisation service to create dynamically responsive digital marketing campaigns that deliver significantly better returns. Andrew Smit Data feeds contain information that helps platforms such as Google and Facebook, determine information about the products as well as when and where to show digital ads. The more relevant the product information is to a user's search, the more likely Google or Facebook will show the ads \u2013 increasing the chance that someone searching for a company's product will find it and make the purchase.\n\"Feed optimisation is one of the more complex aspects of setting up and managing a digital sales campaign. This is especially true for e commerce organisations that offer sizeable inventories, like retailers, travel companies and even real estate agencies, explains Andrew Smit, NMPi's head of data solutions. \"Working closely with Feedonomics has already delivered exceptional results to our international clients and we are seeing solid interest from our South African clients as well.\"\nPoorly managed product data feeds can affect an organisation's listing on the main platforms such as Google, Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest. Inconsistencies can leave buyers and suppliers unsure of available inventory and pricing and can even cause Google to pause ads. For any organisation relying on e commerce channels, this can have dire consequences \u2013 most especially for those making use of Google Shopping and Facebook Dynamic Product Ads.\nFeedonomics has a native integration into the main CMS platforms such as Salesforce, Commerce Cloud, Magento, Shopify and BigCommerce. However, the partnership means NMPi can also work with customised CMSes to extract the product data, which is especially useful for larger clients.\n\"Retailers often have a set it and forget approach for feed optimisation, and we are really excited to partner with NMPi, which recognises the importance of testing and improving product data for better relevancy and performance,\" says Brian Roizen, Chief Architect and Cofounder of Feedonomics.\nThe NMPi team has already done extensive work with Feedonomics for its international clients, with some digital retailers managing inventories with hundreds of thousands of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs).\n\"Feed agility can give a retailer a serious edge in a competitive online landscape. For the larger websites the feeds can be updated a few times each day. In fact, this can happen as frequently as every 10 minutes, which allows retail sites to run specials that can be dynamically managed in real time, responding to user interest as well as what their competitors are doing,\" Smit explains.\nAbout IncuBeta\nIncuBeta, through its brands, NMPi, DQ&A and Joystick, is a global integrated data, performance marketing, digital media, creative and technology group.\nSince its inception in 1995 the group has expanded rapidly, acquiring several digital and media companies including Clicks2Customers in 2011, as well as UK based NetMediaPlanet.

Additional new functionality includes integration with WhatsApp, allowing users to add a WhatsApp 'share' icon on their organisation and/or fundraising project page, enabling people to instantly message friends and family about the fundraising projects they care about to drive donations and awareness.\nDeveloped in partnership with CRM consultancy, Hyphen8, the new CRM functionality, available to all registered funders on The Good Exchange, will allow users to create a comprehensive extract of the grant application data from all projects that have been auto matched or shortlisted to their grant giving criteria and import the data into their CRM based grant management systems. Any grant giving organisation, such as a charitable foundation or trust, using a CRM system to manage their grant funding, could populate their database systems from this extracted data and use it to enhance their decision making while maintaining their own grant management and due diligence processes.\nThe first organisation to use the new functionality will be Oxfordshire Community Foundation (OCF) which will be importing over seventy fields of information about each matched or shortlisted charitable project directly into its Salesforce CRM system to augment the grant management process and enable the Foundation to communicate more quickly and seamlessly with charitable organisations that are looking for grants.\n\"We strongly believe that collaboration and integration is the way forward in the charitable funding sector,\" said Jayne Woodley, CEO, OCF. \"This new functionality will allow us to quickly and easily extract the data about all shortlisted and matched charitable projects directly from The Good Exchange platform into our Salesforce CRM solution, increasing the efficiency of our grant administration processes and decision making as well as facilitating greater engagement with the causes that we support.\"\nMeanwhile, the WhatsApp integration reflects the growing shift towards more private sharing and the popularity and success of WhatsApp (which has an estimated 36 million users in the UK)[1] for personal communication. Charities and Community Groups using The Good Exchange and visitors to their organisational and fundraising project pages will have the option to share links and personalised information with their WhatsApp contacts to publicise fundraising activities and drive more donations. In contrast, while sharing via social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter can reach larger audiences, messages are much less personalised and are broadcast to all followers.\n\"As an organisation with digital at the heart of our ethos and offering, we're always looking for ways to innovate and evolve our platform to augment its charitable matching capabilities and make the grant management and application process faster and easier for everyone,\" said Ed Gairdner, COO of The Good Exchange. \"Thanks to the skills of the Hyphen8 CRM services team, we've been able to start the journey towards a seamless integration between our not for profit platform and leading grant management and CRM solutions. The sharing of information between The Good Exchange's single application form and grant makers' own grant management, CRM systems and application forms will facilitate the matching of charitable fundraising projects to as many grants as possible whilst allowing Trustees to retain full control over the grant making process.\"\nThis will streamline the grant decision making process for every grant maker by minimising the application and shortlisting timetable and cutting the effort required. This will free up time to build deeper relationships with the charitable organisations they support and for collaborating with funders, fundraisers and donors to help close the funding gap and make charitable funding accessible to all sizes and types of charities.\n\"The CRM integration development is a key example of how Hyphen8's passion to work in partnership with non profit organisations to transform the way they work using cloud technologies can benefit the charitable industry as a whole\" said Elaine Forth, CEO, Hyphen8. \"We look forward to working with The Good Exchange going forward to continue to drive CRM based innovation and collaboration in the charitable sector.\"\nGairdner concluded: \"Our decision to support WhatsApp integration is in recognition of the changing communications landscape, in which it has become one of the most popular apps in use across the world. Sharing fundraising information via WhatsApp brings a user friendly, simple and instant way for everyone supporting fundraising organisations on The Good Exchange to communicate about and drive donations for the charitable activities that are closest to their hearts.\n\"Further platform updates are currently underway as we continue to innovate our offering; watch this space!\"\n[1] The global state of digital 2019, Hootsuite: https://hootsuite.com/en gb/resources/digital in 2019\nAbout The Good Exchange The Good Exchange is a transformational not for profit, charity owned cloud platform specifically designed to match those organisations and individuals who have money to give to good causes with those who need it most; on a local, regional and national basis.

comment\nNew functionality includes CRM data sharing and WhatsApp integration\nNewbury, 6th June 2019 \u2013 Not for profit, charity owned on line matching platform, The Good Exchange , has today announced significant updates to its online charitable giving solution, providing the ability to share the information its single application form gathers from charitable causes seeking funding with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems utilised by funders to manage their grant making processes. Additional new functionality includes integration with WhatsApp, allowing users to add a WhatsApp 'share' icon on their organisation and/or fundraising project page, enabling people to instantly message friends and family about the fundraising projects they care about to drive donations and awareness.\nDeveloped in partnership with CRM consultancy, Hyphen8, the new CRM functionality, available to all registered funders on The Good Exchange, will allow users to create a comprehensive extract of the grant application data from all projects that have been auto matched or shortlisted to their grant giving criteria and import the data into their CRM based grant management systems. Any grant giving organisation, such as a charitable foundation or trust, using a CRM system to manage their grant funding, could populate their database systems from this extracted data and use it to enhance their decision making while maintaining their own grant management and due diligence processes.\nThe first organisation to use the new functionality will be Oxfordshire Community Foundation (OCF) which will be importing over seventy fields of information about each matched or shortlisted charitable project directly into its Salesforce CRM system to augment the grant management process and enable the Foundation to communicate more quickly and seamlessly with charitable organisations that are looking for grants.\n\"We strongly believe that collaboration and integration is the way forward in the charitable funding sector,\" said Jayne Woodley, CEO, OCF. \"This new functionality will allow us to quickly and easily extract the data about all shortlisted and matched charitable projects directly from The Good Exchange platform into our Salesforce CRM solution, increasing the efficiency of our grant administration processes and decision making as well as facilitating greater engagement with the causes that we support.\"\nMeanwhile, the WhatsApp integration reflects the growing shift towards more private sharing and the popularity and success of WhatsApp (which has an estimated 36 million users in the UK)[1] for personal communication. Charities and Community Groups using The Good Exchange and visitors to their organisational and fundraising project pages will have the option to share links and personalised information with their WhatsApp contacts to publicise fundraising activities and drive more donations. In contrast, while sharing via social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter can reach larger audiences, messages are much less personalised and are broadcast to all followers.\n\"As an organisation with digital at the heart of our ethos and offering, we're always looking for ways to innovate and evolve our platform to augment its charitable matching capabilities and make the grant management and application process faster and easier for everyone,\" said Ed Gairdner, COO of The Good Exchange. \"Thanks to the skills of the Hyphen8 CRM services team, we've been able to start the journey towards a seamless integration between our not for profit platform and leading grant management and CRM solutions. The sharing of information between The Good Exchange's single application form and grant makers' own grant management, CRM systems and application forms will facilitate the matching of charitable fundraising projects to as many grants as possible whilst allowing Trustees to retain full control over the grant making process.\"\nThis will streamline the grant decision making process for every grant maker by minimising the application and shortlisting timetable and cutting the effort required. This will free up time to build deeper relationships with the charitable organisations they support and for collaborating with funders, fundraisers and donors to help close the funding gap and make charitable funding accessible to all sizes and types of charities.\n\"The CRM integration development is a key example of how Hyphen8's passion to work in partnership with non profit organisations to transform the way they work using cloud technologies can benefit the charitable industry as a whole\" said Elaine Forth, CEO, Hyphen8. \"We look forward to working with The Good Exchange going forward to continue to drive CRM based innovation and collaboration in the charitable sector.\"\nGairdner concluded: \"Our decision to support WhatsApp integration is in recognition of the changing communications landscape, in which it has become one of the most popular apps in use across the world. Sharing fundraising information via WhatsApp brings a user friendly, simple and instant way for everyone supporting fundraising organisations on The Good Exchange to communicate about and drive donations for the charitable activities that are closest to their hearts.\n\"Further platform updates are currently underway as we continue to innovate our offering; watch this space!\"\n[1] The global state of digital 2019, Hootsuite: https://hootsuite.com/en gb/resources/digital in 2019\nAbout The Good Exchange The Good Exchange is a transformational not for profit, charity owned cloud platform specifically designed to match those organisations and individuals who have money to give to good causes with those who need it most; on a local, regional and national basis.

APIs are fast becoming like air and water. Businesses need them to survive.\nThat basic point was driven home recently for Brian Pagano , senior director of Catalysts at Axway Inc., which provides cloud integration and API and identity management software. and former global platform strategist at Google LLC. He recently spoke with a major customer who made it clear that if the firm's API management system went down, the company would be out of business.\n\"That API is their 'open for business' sign,\" Pagano said. \"In the next several years, the only companies that are going to survive are those that are API first.\"\nIndeed, some of the world's most valuable companies, including newly public firms such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc., were built largely on APIs to other services. Getting value from data\nPagano spoke at the APIdays 2019 conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. He made a case that success for most companies will depend on building platforms and mining data driven insights using artificial intelligence and machine learning, all enabled by APIs.\n\"The answer to the question of who's going to win the next round is who is getting the most value from their data,\" Pagano said.\nTo underscore how entrenched APIs have become in the enterprise, eBay Inc. embarked on a journey several years ago to modernize its API suite. The firm now has 23 families of APIs on its platform to support 1.2 billion live listings, according to Gail Frederick (pictured), vice president of mobile and developer ecosystem at eBay.\nThe result is that if APIs suddenly disappeared from eBay's massive e commerce engine, the impact would not be good for the economic health of the company.\n\"Our APIs bring in about $19 billion of gross merchandise sold on our platform every year,\" Frederick said during a presentation at the conference. \"They drive our business.\" Banking as a service\nAPIs are also beginning to play an important role in powering key drivers of the global economy such as the banking industry. BBVA has created an open API marketplace on its website for financial technology companies interested in implementing banking related solutions.\nAPIs for card purchase data, payments and business account documentation are already available. It's all part of banking as a service or BaaS, which is beginning to ripple through both traditional banking and fintech in much the same way that Amazon Web Services Inc.'s packaged services transformed cloud computing.

French is hopeful that will soon facilitate faster payments and seamless integration of third party risk services for user authentication and fraud management.\n\"Developer as customer is just as important as consumer as customer,\" French said. Coherence fuels API economy\nThe experiences of both eBay and BBVA highlight an important trend in the evolving API story. This is not about starting whole new technologies from scratch. It's about using tools to build on services that were already there to begin with and reaping a much greater return for the time and work invested. This is also transforming enterprises internally as well as externally.\n\"We love tools, we love to build things,\" said Uri Sarid , chief technology officer at MuleSoft LLC. \"That combination of leverage and return on investment is what's really fueling this API economy. This is fueling a revolution inside of companies as much as outside of companies.\"\nThat revolution is part of what Sarid characterizes as the \"coherence economy,\" where in areas such as travel, human needs are automatically aligned across an ecosystem of services and products. Planning a trip? Let APIs provide dining, lodging, transportation and entertainment in one seamless experience.\n\"We're not in the business of replacing things,\" Sarid said. \"We're in the business of making things interoperable. That's a coherence that's really only enabled by APIs.\"\nAt the APIdays event, Sarid offered a medical example to make his point. Wearable devices now provide raw data on heart rate, sleep patterns, and more. Health APIs translate that into trends which are sent to physicians to analyze. Prescriptions are ordered, a delivery service is triggered and insurance companies are notified, all enabled by APIs.\nIt's putting the process of turning services into products on steroids, where each API represents services that companies can assemble into coherent offerings delivered through application networks.\n\"We should think of these as productized building blocks,\" Sarid said. \"That's really what the business understands.\" Lack of visibility a concern\nThe rush to mine gold from the API stream has not been without problems along the way. On Tuesday, one researcher noted that the most common vulnerability was a lack of visibility where security teams don't fully know all of the APIs in use within an organization.\nIn the information technology world, projects managed without the IT department's knowledge are often referred to as \"shadow IT.\" The API community is wrestling with this same issue.\n\"We're all familiar with shadow IT,\" said Francois Lascelles , field chief technology officer at Ping Identity Corp. \"Well, there's shadow APIs as well.\"\nThat lack of visibility can translate into problems once APIs are released into the wild. In November, it was discovered that an API vulnerability in an online service offered by the U.S. Postal Service inadvertently exposed account details of 60 million users.\nAnd in February, the property valuation firm LandMark White discovered that an exposed API leaked details and contact information for a number of its high profile clients.\nDespite these setbacks, APIs remain poised to play a major role in the global economy for years to come as businesses from e commerce sites to banks, from travel firms to healthcare join the parade.

Cybercrime Cyberattack\nCloud computing giant Amazon has distanced itself from the massive leak of customer data from Capital One, saying clients are responsible for their own applications.\nYesterday, the financial services company confirmed the breach impacted roughly 100 million individuals in the U.S. and approximately six million people in Canada. Data stolen included 140,000 social security numbers of credit card customers and 80,000 bank account numbers.\nAccording to Capital One, the details were stolen in March via a misconfigured firewall on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) bucket\u2014a cloud server used to store sensitive information.\nIn the wake of the incident, Amazon has refused any blame for the intrusion, as The New York Times reported. The Jeff Bezos owned technology giant said in a statement there was no evidence that its cloud computing services had been compromised by hackers.\nAn Amazon Web Services spokesperson told Newsweek : \"AWS was not compromised in any way and functioned as designed. The perpetrator gained access through a misconfiguration of the web application and not the underlying cloud based infrastructure. As Capital One explained clearly in its disclosure, this type of vulnerability is not specific to the cloud.\" Capital One Data Breach: How to Know If You've Been Affected Read more\nLeaky AWS buckets have been responsible for a stunning amount of unwanted data disclosures in recent years. In July, cybersecurity company UpGuard revealed that an IT contractor called Attunity had a misconfigured server which exposed customer data from a number of other firms, including Netflix and Ford. In 2017, files were leaked from an unsecured database that exposed data of nearly 200 million U.S. voters.\nAmazon has always stressed that AWS provides its clients with full \"ownership and control\" of how they store\u2014and protect\u2014personal or sensitive information. It claims to offer \"sophisticated technical and physical controls\" that are designed to help combat any unauthorized access.\n\"As a customer, you maintain full control of your content and responsibility for configuring access to AWS services and resources,\" Amazon says on its website about the cloud service, adding a single key line that absolves it of leak blame: \"You choose how your content is secured.\"\nIndeed, in many cases AWS data exposures are not the result of technical hacking tricks. In the Attunity case, for example, the files were public and visible in plain text, Bloomberg noted. In the 2017 election leak, cyber researchers said the files were not protected by a password.\nThe FBI has arrested a 33 year old suspect, Paige A. Thompson, in relation to the Capital One incident, noting she used the name \"erratic\" online.\nA criminal complaint said Thompson, who formerly worked at Amazon, had threatened to distribute data obtained from the bank. The suspect allegedly wrote during a Slack conversation in June: \"I've basically strapped myself with a bomb vest, fucking dropping capital ones dox and admitting it. I wanna distribute those buckets I think first.\" She said files contained social security numbers, full names and dates of birth.\nThompson has been charged with one count of computer fraud and abuse. According to the Department of Justice (DoJ), the fraud is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Thompson's hearing will take place August 1.\nOfficials said leaked Capital One data was initially uploaded to a code repository website known as GitHub, prompting an individual to bring it to administrators' attention on July 17.\nFederal agents searched the suspect's Seattle home yesterday and claimed to have seized digital storage devices, including one that contained a copy of the exfiltrated bank data. The complaint said Thompson \"recognizes that she has acted illegally.\"\nRichard Fairbank, CEO of Capital One, said: \"While I am grateful that the perpetrator has been caught, I am deeply sorry for what has happened. I sincerely apologize for the understandable worry this incident must be causing those affected and I am committed to making it right.\" People walk past a branch of the Capital One Bank on April 17, 2019 in New York City. The firm suffered a major cyber intrusion earlier this year, it has confirmed.

The Capital One class action lawsuit was purportedly triggered by a massive data breach estimated to have compromised the personal information of 106 million people residing in the U.S. and Canada, according to CNN.\nThe Capital One Class Action Lawsuit According to the lawsuit filed against the banking giant, the Capital One data breach was not announced until July 2019, even though 100 million U.S. citizens had their personally identifiable information (PII) exposed for four months. The type of information compromised included social security numbers, full names, addresses, dates of birth, zip codes, credit scores, and linked credit card information.\nCapital One allegedly made claims when requesting PII in conjunction with the creation of bank accounts and evaluation of credit card applications that disclosure wouldn't occur and best practices would be employed at all times to ensure prevention of a leak. With that in mind, the four initiating plaintiffs\u2014who seek to represent a nationwide Class with state sub classes in all 50 states\u2014allege the bank breached their contract.\nThe failure to disclose the hack in a punctual fashion has also given rise to counts of Negligence and Negligence Per Se. Finally, the lawsuit claims Capital One is guilty of Unjust Enrichment by gaining financial benefit at the expense of customer's trust in their claims of data protection.\nThe complainants and counsel are seeking class certification, injunctive relief, monetary damage and interest, and treble and punitive damages pursuant to federal and state consumer protection laws.\nA Hacker's Trail The U.S. Justice Department is blaming the Capital One data breach on Paige Thompson, a former software engineer for Amazon Web Services in Seattle. Capital One had been utilizing Amazon's cloud hosting services for some time at the time of the incident.\nThe compromise of the bank's secure information occurred on March 22 and 23, 2019, and seems to include information from credit card applications that are dated as far back as 14 years.\nThompson allegedly boasted about her successful efforts to break into sensitive Capital One information, according to an article posted on July 29, 2019, by The New York Times. She allegedly used the handle \"erratic\" on Twitter and Slack messaging services where she purportedly also posted an invoice from a veterinarian trip for her cat which had her clear identity revealed.\nThe hacker was also an organizer of an online Meetup group, where people with similar interests can arrange social get togethers in the wider community. This Meetup group was centered around those with an interest in \"programming, hacking, and cracking,\" according to the report.\nThompson was arrested in Seattle. The former Amazon software engineer was charged with one count of computer fraud and abuse.\nThe Capital One Lawsuit is Case No. 1:19 cv 04507 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\nJoin a Free Capital One Data Breach Lawsuit Investigation If you applied for a Capital One credit card between 2005 and 2019 in the United States or Canada, you may may qualify to join this Capital One data breach class action lawsuit investigation.\nLearn More\nThis article is not legal advice.

Thompson, who reportedly worked for Amazon Web Services before the digital theft took place.\nCapital One said it discovered the breach on July 19, after details of the hack were posted on the code sharing website GitHub. The complaint filed against Thompson in the District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle said the breach occurred between March 12 and July 17.\nThe Justice Department identified Thompson as a former Seattle technology company software engineer, but The Wall Street Journal reported she worked for AWS from 2015 to 2016. The cloud computing giant is competing for a $10 billion cloud computing contract at the Pentagon.\nThe majority of the nearly 100 million U.S. individuals and 6 million Canadians affected were from small businesses that applied for credit cards between 2005 and 2019. The compromised data included information common to such applications, including dates of birth and self reported income, Capital One said.\nIn some cases, the breach included access of other information, such as 140,000 Social Security numbers for credit card customers and 80,000 linked bank account numbers.\n\"Based on our analysis to date, we believe it is unlikely that the information was used for fraud or disseminated by this individual,\" Capital One said in a statement.\nCapital One will provide free credit monitoring to victims, the company said.

Data stolen included 140,000 social security numbers of credit card customers and 80,000 bank account numbers.\nAccording to Capital One, the details were stolen in March via a misconfigured firewall on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) bucket\u2014a cloud server used to store sensitive information.\nIn the wake of the incident, Amazon has refused any blame for the intrusion, as The New York Times reported. The Jeff Bezos owned technology giant said in a statement there was no evidence that its cloud computing services had been compromised by hackers.\nAn Amazon Web Services spokesperson told Newsweek : \"AWS was not compromised in any way and functioned as designed. The perpetrator gained access through a misconfiguration of the web application and not the underlying cloud based infrastructure. As Capital One explained clearly in its disclosure, this type of vulnerability is not specific to the cloud.\" Capital One Data Breach: How to Know If You've Been Affected Read more\nLeaky AWS buckets have been responsible for a stunning amount of unwanted data disclosures in recent years. In July, cybersecurity company UpGuard revealed that an IT contractor called Attunity had a misconfigured server which exposed customer data from a number of other firms, including Netflix and Ford. In 2017, files were leaked from an unsecured database that exposed data of nearly 200 million U.S. voters.\nAmazon has always stressed that AWS provides its clients with full \"ownership and control\" of how they store\u2014and protect\u2014personal or sensitive information. It claims to offer \"sophisticated technical and physical controls\" that are designed to help combat any unauthorized access.\n\"As a customer, you maintain full control of your content and responsibility for configuring access to AWS services and resources,\" Amazon says on its website about the cloud service, adding a single key line that absolves it of leak blame: \"You choose how your content is secured.\"\nIndeed, in many cases AWS data exposures are not the result of technical hacking tricks. In the Attunity case, for example, the files were public and visible in plain text, Bloomberg noted. In the 2017 election leak, cyber researchers said the files were not protected by a password.\nThe FBI has arrested a 33 year old suspect, Paige A. Thompson, in relation to the Capital One incident, noting she used the name \"erratic\" online.\nA criminal complaint said Thompson, who formerly worked at Amazon, had threatened to distribute data obtained from the bank. The suspect allegedly wrote during a Slack conversation in June: \"I've basically strapped myself with a bomb vest, fucking dropping capital ones dox and admitting it. I wanna distribute those buckets I think first.\" She said files contained social security numbers, full names and dates of birth.\nThompson has been charged with one count of computer fraud and abuse. According to the Department of Justice (DoJ), the fraud is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Thompson's hearing will take place August 1.\nOfficials said leaked Capital One data was initially uploaded to a code repository website known as GitHub, prompting an individual to bring it to administrators' attention on July 17.\nFederal agents searched the suspect's Seattle home yesterday and claimed to have seized digital storage devices, including one that contained a copy of the exfiltrated bank data. The complaint said Thompson \"recognizes that she has acted illegally.\"\nRichard Fairbank, CEO of Capital One, said: \"While I am grateful that the perpetrator has been caught, I am deeply sorry for what has happened. I sincerely apologize for the understandable worry this incident must be causing those affected and I am committed to making it right.\" People walk past a branch of the Capital One Bank on April 17, 2019 in New York City. The firm suffered a major cyber intrusion earlier this year, it has confirmed.

The Capital One class action lawsuit was purportedly triggered by a massive data breach estimated to have compromised the personal information of 106 million people residing in the U.S. and Canada, according to CNN.\nThe Capital One Class Action Lawsuit According to the lawsuit filed against the banking giant, the Capital One data breach was not announced until July 2019, even though 100 million U.S. citizens had their personally identifiable information (PII) exposed for four months. The type of information compromised included social security numbers, full names, addresses, dates of birth, zip codes, credit scores, and linked credit card information.\nCapital One allegedly made claims when requesting PII in conjunction with the creation of bank accounts and evaluation of credit card applications that disclosure wouldn't occur and best practices would be employed at all times to ensure prevention of a leak. With that in mind, the four initiating plaintiffs\u2014who seek to represent a nationwide Class with state sub classes in all 50 states\u2014allege the bank breached their contract.\nThe failure to disclose the hack in a punctual fashion has also given rise to counts of Negligence and Negligence Per Se. Finally, the lawsuit claims Capital One is guilty of Unjust Enrichment by gaining financial benefit at the expense of customer's trust in their claims of data protection.\nThe complainants and counsel are seeking class certification, injunctive relief, monetary damage and interest, and treble and punitive damages pursuant to federal and state consumer protection laws.\nA Hacker's Trail The U.S. Justice Department is blaming the Capital One data breach on Paige Thompson, a former software engineer for Amazon Web Services in Seattle. Capital One had been utilizing Amazon's cloud hosting services for some time at the time of the incident.\nThe compromise of the bank's secure information occurred on March 22 and 23, 2019, and seems to include information from credit card applications that are dated as far back as 14 years.\nThompson allegedly boasted about her successful efforts to break into sensitive Capital One information, according to an article posted on July 29, 2019, by The New York Times. She allegedly used the handle \"erratic\" on Twitter and Slack messaging services where she purportedly also posted an invoice from a veterinarian trip for her cat which had her clear identity revealed.\nThe hacker was also an organizer of an online Meetup group, where people with similar interests can arrange social get togethers in the wider community. This Meetup group was centered around those with an interest in \"programming, hacking, and cracking,\" according to the report.\nThompson was arrested in Seattle. The former Amazon software engineer was charged with one count of computer fraud and abuse.\nThe Capital One Lawsuit is Case No. 1:19 cv 04507 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\nJoin a Free Capital One Data Breach Lawsuit Investigation If you applied for a Capital One credit card between 2005 and 2019 in the United States or Canada, you may may qualify to join this Capital One data breach class action lawsuit investigation.\nLearn More\nThis article is not legal advice.

Businesses need them to survive.\nThat basic point was driven home recently for Brian Pagano , senior director of Catalysts at Axway Inc., which provides cloud integration and API and identity management software. and former global platform strategist at Google LLC. He recently spoke with a major customer who made it clear that if the firm's API management system went down, the company would be out of business.\n\"That API is their 'open for business' sign,\" Pagano said. \"In the next several years, the only companies that are going to survive are those that are API first.\"\nIndeed, some of the world's most valuable companies, including newly public firms such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc., were built largely on APIs to other services. Getting value from data\nPagano spoke at the APIdays 2019 conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. He made a case that success for most companies will depend on building platforms and mining data driven insights using artificial intelligence and machine learning, all enabled by APIs.\n\"The answer to the question of who's going to win the next round is who is getting the most value from their data,\" Pagano said.\nTo underscore how entrenched APIs have become in the enterprise, eBay Inc. embarked on a journey several years ago to modernize its API suite. The firm now has 23 families of APIs on its platform to support 1.2 billion live listings, according to Gail Frederick (pictured), vice president of mobile and developer ecosystem at eBay.\nThe result is that if APIs suddenly disappeared from eBay's massive e commerce engine, the impact would not be good for the economic health of the company.\n\"Our APIs bring in about $19 billion of gross merchandise sold on our platform every year,\" Frederick said during a presentation at the conference. \"They drive our business.\" Banking as a service\nAPIs are also beginning to play an important role in powering key drivers of the global economy such as the banking industry. BBVA has created an open API marketplace on its website for financial technology companies interested in implementing banking related solutions.\nAPIs for card purchase data, payments and business account documentation are already available. It's all part of banking as a service or BaaS, which is beginning to ripple through both traditional banking and fintech in much the same way that Amazon Web Services Inc.'s packaged services transformed cloud computing. Photo: Mark Albertson\n\"Banking as a service is bringing banking its AWS moment,\" Susan French , head of product at BBVA Open Platform, said Tuesday, describing how the bank's API platform was extending its business into the fintech startup world. \"The network effect enables us to create relationships with customers we would not usually have.\"\nBy making APIs available to developers on its platform, BBVA hopes to generate additional new services for its customers. French is hopeful that will soon facilitate faster payments and seamless integration of third party risk services for user authentication and fraud management.\n\"Developer as customer is just as important as consumer as customer,\" French said. Coherence fuels API economy\nThe experiences of both eBay and BBVA highlight an important trend in the evolving API story. This is not about starting whole new technologies from scratch. It's about using tools to build on services that were already there to begin with and reaping a much greater return for the time and work invested. This is also transforming enterprises internally as well as externally.\n\"We love tools, we love to build things,\" said Uri Sarid , chief technology officer at MuleSoft LLC. \"That combination of leverage and return on investment is what's really fueling this API economy. This is fueling a revolution inside of companies as much as outside of companies.\"\nThat revolution is part of what Sarid characterizes as the \"coherence economy,\" where in areas such as travel, human needs are automatically aligned across an ecosystem of services and products. Planning a trip? Let APIs provide dining, lodging, transportation and entertainment in one seamless experience.\n\"We're not in the business of replacing things,\" Sarid said. \"We're in the business of making things interoperable. That's a coherence that's really only enabled by APIs.\"\nAt the APIdays event, Sarid offered a medical example to make his point. Wearable devices now provide raw data on heart rate, sleep patterns, and more. Health APIs translate that into trends which are sent to physicians to analyze. Prescriptions are ordered, a delivery service is triggered and insurance companies are notified, all enabled by APIs.\nIt's putting the process of turning services into products on steroids, where each API represents services that companies can assemble into coherent offerings delivered through application networks.\n\"We should think of these as productized building blocks,\" Sarid said. \"That's really what the business understands.\" Lack of visibility a concern\nThe rush to mine gold from the API stream has not been without problems along the way. On Tuesday, one researcher noted that the most common vulnerability was a lack of visibility where security teams don't fully know all of the APIs in use within an organization.\nIn the information technology world, projects managed without the IT department's knowledge are often referred to as \"shadow IT.\" The API community is wrestling with this same issue.\n\"We're all familiar with shadow IT,\" said Francois Lascelles , field chief technology officer at Ping Identity Corp. \"Well, there's shadow APIs as well.\"\nThat lack of visibility can translate into problems once APIs are released into the wild. In November, it was discovered that an API vulnerability in an online service offered by the U.S. Postal Service inadvertently exposed account details of 60 million users.\nAnd in February, the property valuation firm LandMark White discovered that an exposed API leaked details and contact information for a number of its high profile clients.\nDespite these setbacks, APIs remain poised to play a major role in the global economy for years to come as businesses from e commerce sites to banks, from travel firms to healthcare join the parade. The journey may not always be smooth, but it is a notable chapter in the tech revolution.\n\"Good transformation, like a good sandwich, is always messy,\" said Axway's Pagano. \"This is an existential moment.\" Photo: Tanya Vlahovic/Twitter Since you're here \n We'd like to tell you about our mission and how you can help us fulfill it.

Highlights\nOWNZONES Entertainment Technologies and GrayMeta are extending their integration capabilities to support the use of GrayMeta data in OWNZONES' cloud native media supply chain solution, Connect. The integration with GrayMeta's Platform allows users to more efficiently create multiple content versions and more easily manage media libraries through its rich metadata search features.\n\"We've seen rapid adoption of our Connect tool because of the cost and time savings it provides. By combining our platform with robust data created by GrayMeta's platform, we're stepping beyond traditional workflows, performing functions only possible with the cloud and its scale,\" said Aaron Sloman, CTO of OWNZONES. \"We're excited to strengthen our partnership and deliver an improved user experience for media and entertainment producers.\"\nThe OWNZONES Connect component based digital supply chain solution in the cloud allows users to transform their content into any major format and easily deliver it to multiple endpoints, from a major broadcaster to an Over the Top (OTT) platform. The integration of data created by the GrayMeta Platform using machine learning and AI improves content searchability for entire content libraries, making it easier to customize content for different languages and versions.\nBenefits of the integration include:\nMetadata search in Connect \u2013 The integration enables proxy generation and API compatibility that surfaces data created by GrayMeta into the Connect UI. AI driven insight within the Connect Platform \u2013 Automated search using data created by AI improves content producer's ability to search for video content and create different versions. Access to major AI driven platforms \u2013 GrayMeta users can plug into best of breed artificial intelligence and machine learning services. Time and cost reduction \u2013 The combination of GrayMeta's rich data and Connect's ability to quickly execute tasks, such as building IMF content, streamlines processes and increases ROI. Streamlined cloud migration \u2013 Both tools will work together to automate migration into the cloud, saving large amounts of time users would usually spend analyzing files and executing tasks.\n\"Combining the data of the GrayMeta Platform with OWNZONES' Connect is a first in the entertainment industry, enabling users to leverage an unparalleled amount of information to find content easier than ever,\" said John Motz, chief technology officer at GrayMeta. \"This is the first of many integrations and we're excited to introduce powerful new features that will benefit both our customer bases.\" EVENTS TOP HEADLINES\nNHL's Expanded Snapchat Pact Includes Highlights, Curated Stories (Sports Pro) The National Hockey League has expanded its existi more...\nWhen Will 'Netflix for Games' Become a Reality?

The integration with GrayMeta's Platform allows users to more efficiently create multiple content versions and more easily manage media libraries through its rich metadata search features.\n\"We've seen rapid adoption of our Connect tool because of the cost and time savings it provides. By combining our platform with robust data created by GrayMeta's platform, we're stepping beyond traditional workflows, performing functions only possible with the cloud and its scale,\" said Aaron Sloman, CTO of OWNZONES. \"We're excited to strengthen our partnership and deliver an improved user experience for media and entertainment producers.\"\nThe OWNZONES Connect component based digital supply chain solution in the cloud allows users to transform their content into any major format and easily deliver it to multiple endpoints, from a major broadcaster to an Over the Top (OTT) platform. The integration of data created by the GrayMeta Platform using machine learning and AI improves content searchability for entire content libraries, making it easier to customize content for different languages and versions.\nBenefits of the integration include:\nMetadata search in Connect \u2013 The integration enables proxy generation and API compatibility that surfaces data created by GrayMeta into the Connect UI. AI driven insight within the Connect Platform \u2013 Automated search using data created by AI improves content producer's ability to search for video content and create different versions. Access to major AI driven platforms \u2013 GrayMeta users can plug into best of breed artificial intelligence and machine learning services. Time and cost reduction \u2013 The combination of GrayMeta's rich data and Connect's ability to quickly execute tasks, such as building IMF content, streamlines processes and increases ROI. Streamlined cloud migration \u2013 Both tools will work together to automate migration into the cloud, saving large amounts of time users would usually spend analyzing files and executing tasks.\n\"Combining the data of the GrayMeta Platform with OWNZONES' Connect is a first in the entertainment industry, enabling users to leverage an unparalleled amount of information to find content easier than ever,\" said John Motz, chief technology officer at GrayMeta. \"This is the first of many integrations and we're excited to introduce powerful new features that will benefit both our customer bases.\" EVENTS TOP HEADLINES\nNHL's Expanded Snapchat Pact Includes Highlights, Curated Stories (Sports Pro) The National Hockey League has expanded its existi more...\nWhen Will 'Netflix for Games' Become a Reality?

The integration with GrayMeta's Platform allows users to more efficiently create multiple content versions and more easily manage media libraries through its rich metadata search features.\n\"We've seen rapid adoption of our Connect tool because of the cost and time savings it provides. By combining our platform with robust data created by GrayMeta's platform, we're stepping beyond traditional workflows, performing functions only possible with the cloud and its scale,\" said Aaron Sloman, CTO of OWNZONES. \"We're excited to strengthen our partnership and deliver an improved user experience for media and entertainment producers.\"\nThe OWNZONES Connect component based digital supply chain solution in the cloud allows users to transform their content into any major format and easily deliver it to multiple endpoints, from a major broadcaster to an Over the Top (OTT) platform. The integration of data created by the GrayMeta Platform using machine learning and AI improves content searchability for entire content libraries, making it easier to customize content for different languages and versions.\nBenefits of the integration include:\nMetadata search in Connect \u2013 The integration enables proxy generation and API compatibility that surfaces data created by GrayMeta into the Connect UI. AI driven insight within the Connect Platform \u2013 Automated search using data created by AI improves content producer's ability to search for video content and create different versions. Access to major AI driven platforms \u2013 GrayMeta users can plug into best of breed artificial intelligence and machine learning services. Time and cost reduction \u2013 The combination of GrayMeta's rich data and Connect's ability to quickly execute tasks, such as building IMF content, streamlines processes and increases ROI. Streamlined cloud migration \u2013 Both tools will work together to automate migration into the cloud, saving large amounts of time users would usually spend analyzing files and executing tasks.\n\"Combining the data of the GrayMeta Platform with OWNZONES' Connect is a first in the entertainment industry, enabling users to leverage an unparalleled amount of information to find content easier than ever,\" said John Motz, chief technology officer at GrayMeta. \"This is the first of many integrations and we're excited to introduce powerful new features that will benefit both our customer bases.\" EVENTS TOP HEADLINES\nNHL's Expanded Snapchat Pact Includes Highlights, Curated Stories (Sports Pro) The National Hockey League has expanded its existi more...\nWhen Will 'Netflix for Games' Become a Reality?

During that time, the volume and complexity of monitoring data being produced and consumed increased by 10x year on year. This growth was driven by the movement from a few monolithic applications to thousands of microservices as well as the migration from hundreds of servers to millions of containers. It quickly became obvious that neither the open source solutions Mao and Skillington were using at the time, nor commercially available solutions, could sustain the level of scale, performance and cost required by the team. The only course of action they saw was to build a new solution M3 which they developed in open source from day one for the benefit of the community at large. Over the course of four years, Mao and Skillington led the team that scaled M3 to one of the largest production metrics systems in the world, storing tens of billions of time series while both ingesting and querying billions of datapoints per second. This provided Uber with comprehensive insight into its infrastructure and applications for engineers and real time visibility of the overall business for operations teams.\n\"We started by writing an open source streaming metrics aggregator and distributed time series database that would scale with the business and operate with zero downtime when availability zones experienced failures,\" said Skillington. \"At Chronosphere, the team is focused on providing something that companies can start using within minutes, while we continue to develop and maintain M3 as open source.\"\nAfter recognizing that other high growth companies struggled with the same challenges as they moved to a cloud native architecture, Mao and Skillington went on to found Chronosphere so they could bring the benefits of M3 to enterprises everywhere while continuing to support the open source community which comprises 7 of the Fortune 200 including Comcast and FedEx.\nThe first Chronosphere product is a hosted end to end monitoring platform which is built on top of M3. Chronosphere's platform adds enterprise features such as intelligent rate limiting, resource management and security and access controls such that all teams within an organization can leverage the power of a single centralized platform. Chronosphere also provides visualization and alerting capabilities that are designed to provide for sane operability at scale given the volume of underlying data. The platform also helps auto categorize the data and extracts higher level meaning for deeper insights.\nToday Chronosphere also announced $11 million in Series A funding led by Greylock with participation from Lux Capital.\n\"For enterprises, there is a huge unmet need for high dimensionality (HD) metrics at scale with global reliability and low cost,\" said Jerry Chen, partner at Greylock. \"Chronosphere enables enterprises to run their business at a resolution that isn't available from existing open source and commercial offerings. It's like using a 4K monitor to run your business: once you use HD you can't go back to VGA.\" The Latest AIOps for Networking the Dawning of a New Era November 05, 2019\n change.

How does a WAN cloud exchange work? WAN cloud exchanges provide private and secure connectivity to cloud environments, making them beneficial for software defined WAN and SaaS platforms. John Burke Nemertes Research\nA WAN cloud exchange or just cloud exchange enables enterprises to connect with cloud service providers without sending traffic solely over the internet.\nEnterprises usually connect to a WAN cloud exchange using a dedicated physical connection in a meet me facility, such as a data center hosting site. The exchange provider connects the exchange's network directly to a variety of cloud providers' networks.\nEnterprises spin up virtual circuits with the exchange to connect to cloud providers' networks. They still have to buy the right to do so, however; for example, they may buy the right to set up an Azure ExpressRoute from Microsoft or a Direct Connect gateway from AWS.\nWAN cloud exchanges provide more secure connections and more consistent performance, which reduce business and operational risk. Cloud exchanges work well with software defined WAN technology, which uses them as another available path to a cloud destination and routes traffic through them according to defined security and performance policies. WAN cloud exchange providers\nWAN cloud exchange providers include most telecoms companies, such as AT&T and Comcast; network as a service providers, such as Aryaka; and most large data center hosting providers, such as Equinix. Many enterprises have multiple options available from their current partner list, and they should always include those partners in their evaluations.

Microsoft is becoming a strategic partner in enterprises' digital transformations, and key parts of its portfolio (Azure and O365) are serving mission critical functions. With the unmatched depth and breadth of its technology portfolio, we believe that the company has multiple levers to grow revenue, margins, and its customer base over the next several years, evidenced by multiyear double digit revenue growth at an unmatched scale.\nIn a world increasingly moving to the cloud, but still encumbered by legacy investments that sit elsewhere and still drive value today, Microsoft is uniquely positioned to take an increasingly large percentage of corporate information technology budgets. While Microsoft's increasingly recurring revenue model remains untested in a weaker demand environment, we believe that this scenario could ultimately benefit the company long term, as it affords Microsoft an opportunity to 1) pitch consolidation sales, and 2) capitalize on its very strong balance sheet (we believe that the company could play offense in a way that most companies could not in such an environment). Price target: $160.\nSnap SNAP NYSE\nOverweight Price $14 on Oct. 22\nby J.P. Morgan\nWe are upgrading Snap from Neutral with a $17 price target to Overweight with a $20 target. We believe that Snap shares are increasingly compelling, following a 20% plus pullback from recent highs and after delivering third quarter results that showed more encouraging trends.\nImportantly, we believe that Snap's platform and business have both improved dramatically over the past several quarters: 1) daily active users have now increased for three straight quarters, accelerating to 13% growth in the third quarter, while daily time spent continues to run at 300 plus minutes/user, and is increasingly spent in Discover; 2) revenue growth accelerated for the third straight quarter, and we are encouraged by Snap's potential to attract more advertisers through self serve, particularly more of those with always on spending; 3) we believe that Snap is at an inflection point with positive Ebitda for the first time in fourth quarter 2019 and, we believe, the first full year in 2020, with positive free cash flow not far behind; and 4) we also believe that Snap is setting up a number of longer term initiatives in maps, gaming, and augmented reality wearables.\nOur $20 price target is based on about 11 times 2020 estimated revenue.\nVarian Medical Systems VAR NYSE\nOutperform Price $117.40 on Oct. 24\nby Barrington Research\nVarian delivered revenue of $878.9 million [in its fiscal fourth quarter], versus our estimate of $844.5 million, and reported a non GAAP EPS figure of $1.21, versus our $1.19 expectation.

It's the week ended November 1. And you've got Lindsey O'Donnell and Tara Seals here with Threatpost to talk about this week's top news security stories. Tara, how are you doing today?\nTara Seals: I'm good. How are you doing Lindsey? Happy post Halloween.\nLO: Good. Yeah, it's funny you say that. I was just laughing because there's been a whole lot of Halloween themed news headlines and pitches that I've been seeing in my inbox with Halloween being yesterday. You know, I've seen like trick or treat malicious Android apps, spooky malware.\nTS: Yeah, I had one that was the top horror stories of 2019 so far, the things that lurk in the shadows. They really went full on into it this year.\nLO: Yeah, people really got into it this year. So yeah, just looking at some of the biggest stories that we had this week, one story that really kicked off the week was this article about Fancy Bear attacking anti doping and sporting organizations globally. That really kicked off the week and set off a storm of news articles and discussions around that. But what happened there was that Microsoft came out with an alert and said that at least 16 anti doping agencies and sporting organizations were hit by cyberattacks, and that it had detected those attacks going back to the Russian threat group Fancy Bear, which you may know as APT28 or Sofacy. So basically, they didn't specify the names of the targeted companies, but they did say that it was interesting timing with the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo happening next summer. And they also mentioned that these attacks coincided with a warning that had happened, I think it was a few weeks ago, by the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA), that Russia could face a ban from all major sporting events over discrepancies in a lab database. If you've been following, there's the whole kind of anti doping issue there.\nTS: Yeah, it's a bit of a retread, too. Because if you remember, Fancy Bear also attacked WADA, the World Anti Doping Agency, a few years ago when Russia was banned from the Olympics, and that was the retaliation obviously, you know, Fancy Bear is widely considered to be linked with the Russian government. So some people think that this is obviously a retaliation for that, circumstantial evidence points in that direction. But the previous hack a couple years ago, that they did things like, they released Simone Biles' medical records, because she had to take something for cortisone for an injury or something very innocuous, but they released that. Like, \"look, she's on meds.\" They also did the same thing with Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal, the tennis stars. And so, they have a history of this. And they're just going back to their old tactics, which I think is interesting. I mean, you know, I don't know what they're trying to accomplish, necessarily.\nLO: Yeah. And you know, what's interesting, too, they had hacked these organizations in 2018. And then also in 2016. I'm just kind of surprised that this is happening yet again. And these organizations, these anti doping organizations haven't set up protections in place from however they're being infected or attacked. And you know, it is something that they really should be taking seriously. I actually reached out to the World Anti Doping Agency and asked them if they were one of the victims. And they said that there hadn't been any evidence of a breach on their systems at this point. That's not to say they haven't been targeted, but at the same time, maybe they have set up the correct protections in place at this point.\nTS: Yeah, well, I think Microsoft did say in its alert that most of the attacks were not successful. So, you know, maybe they have learned from past hacks. I think Microsoft said some of them were, but the majority were not. So this is better than before, when Fancy Bear seem to just be able to infiltrate whoever they set their sights on, so maybe we have come a little way down the road. But yeah, I mean, it just goes to show the geopolitical nature of APT activity. And there's a lot of sort of, \"we're going to get you back for that\" kind of stuff going on.\nLO: Right. Yeah. And I mean, that's not even the only state sponsored APT activity that we wrote about this week too. We also wrote about APT41 , which I actually haven't heard about for a while, but they emerged in this new FireEye report that basically said that they had breached a telecom SMS server and used that breach to sniff out certain cell phone numbers and SMS messages for various political dissidents. So if you know about APT41, they are typically China linked and they have in the past carried out state sponsored activity as well as financially motivated activity. And it appears that this latest attack has been around cyber espionage. So you know, just more APT activity out there this week.\nTS: You know, I would love to know how these carriers were infiltrated in the first place. I mean, it's kind of shocking.\nLO: Yeah, I was surprised that FireEye didn't have any further comment or detail about how these installation scripts that basically infected the servers got onto the servers in the first place. You know, they didn't provide a lot of detail around that, they, as you mentioned, they didn't mention who the four various telecom providers were. I think they were focusing more on \u2013 I'm sure they had their reasons \u2013 but they had, they were focusing more on kind of the cyber espionage activity itself. And as you also mentioned, I think it's also important to note that these attacks were highly targeted. So what the APT group was doing was, it had a kind of predetermined list of keywords that it was looking for in certain SMS messages. And those keywords would have things like political leaders or military intelligence organizations or political movements at odds with the Chinese government. And if the SMS messages that they were able to sniff out, using these telecom networks, contained any of the keywords, then the malware that they had installed on the telecom servers would save the SMS message and kind of ship it out to the threat actors' C2. So that was interesting. And then in addition to that, they also were looking for very specific information as well as such as the IMSI numbers, which is like the unique identity of different mobile devices. And then also the specific phone numbers. So like, if someone placed a phone call, they would, you know, scoop up the destination phone number, and then the phone number that had made the call as well.\nTS: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of breathtaking, when you think about the fact that they must have some sort of AI engine in the background. I mean, there are a lot of resources that must have gone into this attack, because if you think about how many text messages you send per day, right? I mean, I send a lot. And think about every single person within the footprint, even if they were just targeting one city (which that's also information that we don't know, if they were zeroing in on certain geographic areas or whatever). Let's just say you hack a carrier's SMS server, and then basically you have this firehose of all of these millions and millions and millions of text messages coming through. And they're just sifting through, looking for keywords, and then they have to figure out if it's a coincidence that a person happened to use that keyword or if it's someone that would be of interest to them, then they pivot and look for that person's associates by looking at the phone numbers that they call and who calls them. It's just this very elaborate surveillance operation that seems really massive in terms of the amount of information that has to be sifted through and analyzed and sliced and diced. So I don't know, the whole thing kind of boggles my mind, from the fact that they managed to hack a telecom network in the first place to the amount of information that they have to analyze on the back end \u2013 this is this is kind of a big deal it seems to me.\nLO: I mean I would be interested \u2013 as we mentioned before details are scant at this point \u2013 but I would be interested as more comes out. Typically what researchers will do is they'll publish subsequent research in the future as more details come out about these types of attacks, so I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for any kind of future FireEye information that comes forward about this specific attack.\nTS: FireEye Mandiant we're calling you out. We need more details. We need to know more.\nLO: Yeah, definitely keeping an eye out for that. So speaking of cyberattacks, there were quite a few of those this week. And one such cyberattack that caught my eye was something you wrote about Tara which was the data breach of Bed Bath & Beyond, which I frequent quite often.\nTS: Yeah, they disclosed a data breach, but it was kind of interesting. They did it through an SEC filing, and didn't really make any announcement on their website or anything like that. They're kind of keeping it a bit hush hush. The details are very scant, they basically said that somebody was able to get ahold of a password and email combination that then able to use to eventually access customers' online accounts. But that's basically all they said about it. And they said that this affects less than 1 percent of the company's online customer accounts, which sounds like no big deal until you think about the fact that they get 4 million website visitors per month. The 1 percent can still translate into a really large number of people.\nLO: Right. Well, you talked to a couple of researchers who even though details were super limited for this one, they actually had some really interesting perspectives in terms of how you're able to look on Dark Web and find out some more information there. So I thought that was a great angle to take this story and dig deeper into the impact of this breach and how this could have happened as well.\nTS: Yeah, it was really interesting because Colin Bastable, who is the CEO of Lucy Security, they specialize in employee security training, and he was saying that it kind of smacks of a supply chain issue. So maybe somebody was able to penetrate a third party supplier of services to the website, and then be able to from there gain administrative privileges and pivot to move laterally and all that kind of stuff, which of course, we've seen that a lot in the past. These supply chain attacks, like with the Ticketmaster breach , for example, with Magecart , they were able to compromise a third party component and then from there, be able to go after the real target. And obviously in the infamous Target breach a few years ago, and that was an HVAC supplier , right, so they were able to pivot through that network to get to the Target network, so we've seen these types of things before. And so he thought that was maybe what had happened. That was one theory. And now the other theory was that somebody just got phished, you know, there was some internal administrative person who fell for a spearphishing email and they were off to the races.\nLO: I'm definitely more curious about that. And I know you mentioned this too in your story, but I saw separate reports of ImmuniWeb's analysis of various stolen credentials, speaking of which, that were found on the Dark Web, I thought there were some interesting points there too about how many credentials belonging to what types and sizes of companies that have been found on the Dark Web. And I think that you had written that as many as 95 percent of the credentials contained unencrypted \u2013 or bruteforced and cracked by the attackers \u2013 plain text passwords. So that's just a massive number. And that shed some light on to the credential issue that we're dealing with and how that might impact the story as well.\nTS: Yeah, definitely. And I don't know if you've gone Have I Been Pwned , you know, Troy Hunt's website, you can plug in your email and see if anybody has compromised it, or your password. The ImmuniWeb analysis found that there were 21 million different sets of credentials belonging to just the Fortune 500 alone. Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the Fortune 500, they're like number 200 something. If I were a large enterprise, I would be concerned with that. So, these credentials are out there. Now, whether or not they're still valid, whether or not people have changed their passwords on a regular basis or not, who knows? But it's definitely an epidemic.\nLO: Yeah, well speaking of credentials, the final story I wanted to discuss that you wrote about was really interesting. It was about a phishing attack that was using a fake voicemail message to lure victims into revealing their Office 365 email credentials. I thought that was kind of a interesting angle there for attackers to take. What did you find there?\nTS: Yes, researchers at McAfee that uncovered this campaign, they were saying that it's really unusual because if you're a targeted victim, you would get this email in your inbox that said, \"hey, you missed a voicemail so why don't you sign on to your Office 365 online, login to the cloud. So you can listen to your voicemail.\" It was just such an unusual tactic that hasn't really been seen before. And a lot of people apparently are falling for it.\nLO : So they had the actual audio attachment, is that it?\nTS: Yeah, well, they were fake audio attachments. So if you're a recipient of one of these emails, you see that there's an audio file attached, that just has a snippet that has somebody talking like, \"Hi, I'm calling about blah, blah, blah,\" and then it cuts it off. So it's just a little sample basically to tease people and say, \"you want to listen to the rest of the voicemail, sign in to Office 365 online.\"\nLO: I think that the audio aspect of it is very interesting. And researchers who I've talked to have said that audio is going to be kind of the n ext tactic that a lot of attackers are going to be using for different phishing campaigns. And I know we saw that audio deep fake a couple of weeks ago, where someone deep faked audio and essentially used that to scam a company. So I think between that, and then this, I'm concerned about how audio will be used in the future because a lot of employers nowadays are trained to look and look for kind of visual clues and red flags in various phishing emails. But then when it comes to audio, you know, there's not a lot of training there for that.\nTS: Yeah, now that's a really good point. I had forgotten about that, that deep fake, where the person basically impersonated the CEO of the company, and it was indistinguishable from the real thing. I think that we tend to trust our ears more than something that we have popping up in our email box that you just read. We like to think that we're savvy types that can discern whether or not something's real or not, but that's changing overtime. If you read that whole feature article about deepfakes that you wrote, and how that's changing the security game, I think that's just fascinating.\nLO: It's definitely concerning and something to be on the lookout for. So, Tara, thanks for coming onto the news wrap. We should probably wrap it up now.\nTS: I can talk to you all afternoon Lindsey.\nLO: If only we didn't have to go write more stories.\nTS: Yeah, we have to get back to work. That's right.\nLO: For everyone listening. Thanks for joining in. Catch us next week on the Threatpost news wrap that we'll get up next Friday. We usually go live every Friday.

It's the week ended November 1. And you've got Lindsey O'Donnell and Tara Seals here with Threatpost to talk about this week's top news security stories. Tara, how are you doing today?\nTara Seals: I'm good. How are you doing Lindsey? Happy post Halloween.\nLO: Good. Yeah, it's funny you say that. I was just laughing because there's been a whole lot of Halloween themed news headlines and pitches that I've been seeing in my inbox with Halloween being yesterday. You know, I've seen like trick or treat malicious Android apps, spooky malware.\nTS: Yeah, I had one that was the top horror stories of 2019 so far, the things that lurk in the shadows. They really went full on into it this year.\nLO: Yeah, people really got into it this year. So yeah, just looking at some of the biggest stories that we had this week, one story that really kicked off the week was this article about Fancy Bear attacking anti doping and sporting organizations globally. That really kicked off the week and set off a storm of news articles and discussions around that. But what happened there was that Microsoft came out with an alert and said that at least 16 anti doping agencies and sporting organizations were hit by cyberattacks, and that it had detected those attacks going back to the Russian threat group Fancy Bear, which you may know as APT28 or Sofacy. So basically, they didn't specify the names of the targeted companies, but they did say that it was interesting timing with the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo happening next summer. And they also mentioned that these attacks coincided with a warning that had happened, I think it was a few weeks ago, by the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA), that Russia could face a ban from all major sporting events over discrepancies in a lab database. If you've been following, there's the whole kind of anti doping issue there.\nTS: Yeah, it's a bit of a retread, too. Because if you remember, Fancy Bear also attacked WADA, the World Anti Doping Agency, a few years ago when Russia was banned from the Olympics, and that was the retaliation obviously, you know, Fancy Bear is widely considered to be linked with the Russian government. So some people think that this is obviously a retaliation for that, circumstantial evidence points in that direction. But the previous hack a couple years ago, that they did things like, they released Simone Biles' medical records, because she had to take something for cortisone for an injury or something very innocuous, but they released that. Like, \"look, she's on meds.\" They also did the same thing with Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal, the tennis stars. And so, they have a history of this. And they're just going back to their old tactics, which I think is interesting. I mean, you know, I don't know what they're trying to accomplish, necessarily.\nLO: Yeah. And you know, what's interesting, too, they had hacked these organizations in 2018. And then also in 2016. I'm just kind of surprised that this is happening yet again. And these organizations, these anti doping organizations haven't set up protections in place from however they're being infected or attacked. And you know, it is something that they really should be taking seriously. I actually reached out to the World Anti Doping Agency and asked them if they were one of the victims. And they said that there hadn't been any evidence of a breach on their systems at this point. That's not to say they haven't been targeted, but at the same time, maybe they have set up the correct protections in place at this point.\nTS: Yeah, well, I think Microsoft did say in its alert that most of the attacks were not successful. So, you know, maybe they have learned from past hacks. I think Microsoft said some of them were, but the majority were not. So this is better than before, when Fancy Bear seem to just be able to infiltrate whoever they set their sights on, so maybe we have come a little way down the road. But yeah, I mean, it just goes to show the geopolitical nature of APT activity. And there's a lot of sort of, \"we're going to get you back for that\" kind of stuff going on.\nLO: Right. Yeah. And I mean, that's not even the only state sponsored APT activity that we wrote about this week too. We also wrote about APT41 , which I actually haven't heard about for a while, but they emerged in this new FireEye report that basically said that they had breached a telecom SMS server and used that breach to sniff out certain cell phone numbers and SMS messages for various political dissidents. So if you know about APT41, they are typically China linked and they have in the past carried out state sponsored activity as well as financially motivated activity. And it appears that this latest attack has been around cyber espionage. So you know, just more APT activity out there this week.\nTS: You know, I would love to know how these carriers were infiltrated in the first place. I mean, it's kind of shocking.\nLO: Yeah, I was surprised that FireEye didn't have any further comment or detail about how these installation scripts that basically infected the servers got onto the servers in the first place. You know, they didn't provide a lot of detail around that, they, as you mentioned, they didn't mention who the four various telecom providers were. I think they were focusing more on \u2013 I'm sure they had their reasons \u2013 but they had, they were focusing more on kind of the cyber espionage activity itself. And as you also mentioned, I think it's also important to note that these attacks were highly targeted. So what the APT group was doing was, it had a kind of predetermined list of keywords that it was looking for in certain SMS messages. And those keywords would have things like political leaders or military intelligence organizations or political movements at odds with the Chinese government. And if the SMS messages that they were able to sniff out, using these telecom networks, contained any of the keywords, then the malware that they had installed on the telecom servers would save the SMS message and kind of ship it out to the threat actors' C2. So that was interesting. And then in addition to that, they also were looking for very specific information as well as such as the IMSI numbers, which is like the unique identity of different mobile devices. And then also the specific phone numbers. So like, if someone placed a phone call, they would, you know, scoop up the destination phone number, and then the phone number that had made the call as well.\nTS: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of breathtaking, when you think about the fact that they must have some sort of AI engine in the background. I mean, there are a lot of resources that must have gone into this attack, because if you think about how many text messages you send per day, right? I mean, I send a lot. And think about every single person within the footprint, even if they were just targeting one city (which that's also information that we don't know, if they were zeroing in on certain geographic areas or whatever). Let's just say you hack a carrier's SMS server, and then basically you have this firehose of all of these millions and millions and millions of text messages coming through. And they're just sifting through, looking for keywords, and then they have to figure out if it's a coincidence that a person happened to use that keyword or if it's someone that would be of interest to them, then they pivot and look for that person's associates by looking at the phone numbers that they call and who calls them. It's just this very elaborate surveillance operation that seems really massive in terms of the amount of information that has to be sifted through and analyzed and sliced and diced. So I don't know, the whole thing kind of boggles my mind, from the fact that they managed to hack a telecom network in the first place to the amount of information that they have to analyze on the back end \u2013 this is this is kind of a big deal it seems to me.\nLO: I mean I would be interested \u2013 as we mentioned before details are scant at this point \u2013 but I would be interested as more comes out. Typically what researchers will do is they'll publish subsequent research in the future as more details come out about these types of attacks, so I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for any kind of future FireEye information that comes forward about this specific attack.\nTS: FireEye Mandiant we're calling you out. We need more details. We need to know more.\nLO: Yeah, definitely keeping an eye out for that. So speaking of cyberattacks, there were quite a few of those this week. And one such cyberattack that caught my eye was something you wrote about Tara which was the data breach of Bed Bath & Beyond, which I frequent quite often.\nTS: Yeah, they disclosed a data breach, but it was kind of interesting. They did it through an SEC filing, and didn't really make any announcement on their website or anything like that. They're kind of keeping it a bit hush hush. The details are very scant, they basically said that somebody was able to get ahold of a password and email combination that then able to use to eventually access customers' online accounts. But that's basically all they said about it. And they said that this affects less than 1 percent of the company's online customer accounts, which sounds like no big deal until you think about the fact that they get 4 million website visitors per month. The 1 percent can still translate into a really large number of people.\nLO: Right. Well, you talked to a couple of researchers who even though details were super limited for this one, they actually had some really interesting perspectives in terms of how you're able to look on Dark Web and find out some more information there. So I thought that was a great angle to take this story and dig deeper into the impact of this breach and how this could have happened as well.\nTS: Yeah, it was really interesting because Colin Bastable, who is the CEO of Lucy Security, they specialize in employee security training, and he was saying that it kind of smacks of a supply chain issue.

Drew Angerer\u2014Getty Images By Aaron Pressman 8:55 AM EDT\nThis is the web version of Data Sheet, Fortune's daily newsletter on the top tech news. To get it delivered daily to your in box, sign up here.\nHappy Monday. Aaron here, back from vacation, essay writing and curating this week, as Adam goes off on a break.\nCatching up on all the tech news while I was away, I was sent spiraling down memory lane by Friday's GeekWire scoop that Microsoft maintains a list of \"prohibited and discouraged technology.\" Said list is said to ban popular work messaging app Slack (which we use at Fortune ) and online grammar checker Grammarly, while discouraging use of Google Docs, Amazon Web Services, and cloud security company PagerDuty. The various rationales offered in the document cite security concerns, but also the obvious rivalry aspects. For example: \"Slack Enterprise Grid version complies with Microsoft security requirements; however, we encourage use of Microsoft Teams rather than a competitive software.\" Microsoft declined to comment to GeekWire.\nThere's a long history of tech companies eschewing the products of their competitors. Google stopped its employees from using Microsoft Windows a decade ago, also citing security issues, and Microsoft discouraged use of the Apple iPhone early in the smartphone era.\nPersonally, I was sent back to my tenure at Yahoo, when CEO Marissa Mayer only allowed use of the company's ad laden, performance challenged web client for all work email. The proffered explanation was that the limitation would prompt employees to offer feedback\u2013and likely push for rapid improvements\u2013to help the engineers on the web email team better the product. That happened some, but it also sapped the productivity of people in jobs that depended on robust email communications capabilities, like, say, salespeople\u2013or reporters.\nThe new banned list at Microsoft is a bit surprising given that part of CEO Satya Nadella's successful strategy for reviving the software giant has been to embrace other platforms and abandon the only made here mindset. At the very least, deeply knowing the competition would help ensure Microsoft's own products keep pace. Historically, that may have been part of the problem behind what Bill Gates just called \"one of the greatest mistakes of all time.\" Appearing at an event at VC firm Village Global last week, Gates admitted he made that all time whopper by failing to create the mobile operating system alternative to Apple's iOS. Instead, Google, where co founder Sergey Brin was an early fan and avid user of the iPhone , grabbed the other spot. Gates called it a $400 billion mistake.\nHopefully, history won't repeat, despite the bans.\nAaron Pressman @ampressman aaron.pressman@fortune.com NEWSWORTHY\nThis time is different. It's been a banner beginning of summer for bitcoin investors, as the cryptocurrency on Monday traded above $11,000 for the first time in more than a year. Still a ways to go before bitcoin surmounts its previous high around $20,000 reached at the end of 2017, however.\nVirtually tit for tat. President Trump may have pulled back from standard military attacks on Iran last week, but he allowed a cyberattack on the country's rocket and missile launch computer systems to go forward, The Washington Post reports. Then on Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security warned U.S. businesses to beware of Iranian computer strikes. \"These are the guys that come in and they burn the house down,\" Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at DHS, said. The administration is also considering a further crackdown on the Chinese tech sector by requiring that all equipment used in U.S. 5G mobile networks be designed and manufactured outside of China. Even European telecom gear makers Nokia and Ericsson manufacture their products in China.\nFollow the money. Elsewhere in the nation's capitol, two senators plan to introduce legislation on Monday that would force tech companies like Google and Facebook to disclose the value of the user data they collect. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley announced their bill on Sunday night, dubbed the Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight And Regulations on Data, or DASHBOARD, Act on Sunday night.\nKeeping me up at night. A few new entries in the files of things to be concerned about. A New York Times story questions why Amazon allows counterfeit book listings. And The Los Angeles Times debates the collection of video by Amazon and Walmart's in home home delivery services.\nSize doesn't matter. Also a couple of news bits on the Raspberry Pi beat. NASA says the hackers who last year stole data about upcoming Mars missions cracked network security by breaching an unauthorized Pi computer connected to its network at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. On Monday, the nonprofit Raspberry Pi Foundation unveiled its fourth generation model of the credit card sized computer. Starting at $35, the Raspberry Pi 4 gets faster insides, more memory, and more ports.\nStart saving your pennies. We've got a new leak about Apple's rumored 16 inch laptop. The larger version of the MacBook Pro will have the highest screen resolution ever on an Apple laptop at 3072 pixels by 1920 pixels and will cost over $3,000.\nAdvertisement FOOD FOR THOUGHT\nSometimes it feels like Silicon Valley is leading a charge against the value of experienced employees, but that's not the case with venture capitalist Jeff Jordan of Andreessen Horowitz. In a profile of the seasoned, 60 year old investor, Fortune's own Polina Marinova examines Jordan's approach that led to winning early investments in Airbnb, Pinterest, and Instacart, among others. His prior work experience at stops including Disney and eBay were key to recognizing the winners, she writes. For example:\nJordan's first reaction to Airbnb was that it was \"the stupidest idea I had ever heard.\" It was 2011, and he was at an Allen & Co. tech investing meeting in Arizona. Brian Chesky, then a relatively unknown entrepreneur, was explaining his business, and Jordan couldn't help mentally listing the number of risks associated with opening up one's home to strangers. Then it hit him. Airbnb's fast growth and online marketplace that matched homeowners with renters reminded him of eBay. It was, he says, \"a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience.\" Having worked in top positions at eBay for seven years, he literally had seen this picture before.\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT\nElectric Planes, Flying Taxis, Supersonic Jets: Paris Air Show Gives Us a Peek at the Future of Flight By Phil Boucher\nWe Didn't Understand the Risks': Neil Armstrong's Sons Remember Life Under an Apollo 11 Astronaut's Roof By Alyssa Newcomb\nExclusive: Wells Fargo Favored Mortgage Master Blend Raises $130 Million By Robert Hackett\n7,000 Dogs Are Registered to Come to 'Work' at Amazon's Headquarters By Chris Morris\nWhy Barnes & Noble May Soon Look Like the Local Bookstores It Killed Off By Phil Wahba\nSorry Google\u2014Funding More Homes Won't Solve the Bay Area Housing Crunch By Stephane Kasriel\nWhy Focusing on Diversity Numbers Won't Really Make Companies More Inclusive By Tim Ryan\nAdvertisement BEFORE YOU GO\nI will not end my first newsletter back from vacation with tales of the delicious meals, amazing sites, and beautiful art I saw in Italy.

Zacks Equity Research Read More Hide Full Article\nFor Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 21, 2019 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research Shares of General Mills ( GIS Free Report ) as the Bull of the Day, Douglas Dynamics ( PLOW Free Report ) asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on CDW Corporation ( CDW Free Report ) , Applied Materials, Inc. ( AMAT Free Report ) and Microsoft ( MSFT Free Report ).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:\nBull of the Day :\nGuess what folks? The market is at all time highs. You can go ahead and rejoice now, thanking the FOMC for their upcoming easing. Now if we can get a trade deal done, there will be no stopping us at all. With all this momentum, it may feel like you can run out there and buy any stock that shows up on your computer screen. I'm going to warn you against that. Eventually, the momentum will die down and those stocks with strong earnings trends will hang in there. One way to find stocks with strong earnings trends is by leaning on the power of the Zacks Rank.\nToday's Bull of the Day is a stock in the good graces of the Zacks Rank. It's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) General Mills. General Mills, Inc. manufactures and markets branded consumer foods worldwide. The company operates in five segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice; Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet. It offers ready to eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit, and savory snacks, as well as organic products, including refrigerated yogurt, nutrition bars, meal kits, salty snacks, ready to eat cereal, and grain snacks.\nThe reason for the favorable rank lies in the series of earnings estimate revisions to the upside. Over the last thirty days, three analysts have increased their estimates for the current year and next year. The bullish sentiment has pushed up the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year to $3.15 while next year's number is up at $3.35.\nYou can see the strong move in earnings estimates on the Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart. Estimates bottomed out late last year, then began to move upwards. You can see the upswing in not only 2018 estimates, but also a nice trend higher for 2019 and 2020. The gaps between these lines shows the year over year growth upcoming as well.\nBear of the Day :\nFinally, the market is back to trading at all time highs. We can thank the FOMC for their contributions with their upcoming easing. Now if we can get a US China trade deal done, there will be no stopping us at all. With all this momentum, it may feel like you can run out there and buy any stock that shows up on your computer screen. I'm going to warn you against that. Eventually, the momentum will die down and those stocks with weak earnings trends will come under pressure. One way to avoid these weak trends is by leaning on the Zacks Rank. Those stocks with favorable Zacks Ranks have very strong earnings trends. Those with weak ranks, have been coming under pressure.\nToday's Bear of the Day is a stock with a weaker earnings trend. I'm talking about Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) Douglas Dynamics. Douglas Dynamics, Inc. operates as a manufacturer and upfitter of commercial work truck attachments and equipment primarily in North America. It operates in two segments, Work Truck Attachments and Work Truck Solutions. The Work Truck Attachments segment manufactures and sells snow and ice control attachments, including snowplows, and sand and salt spreaders for light and heavy duty trucks, as well as various related parts and accessories.\nThe Automotive \u2013 Replacement Parts industry is in the Bottom 14% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Douglas Dynamics is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The reason for the unfavorable rank lies in recent earnings estimate revisions to the downside coming from analysts. Looking at the next quarter number, analyst has dropped his number, bringing down our Zacks Consensus Estimate from 54 cents to 43 cents. That 43 cent number would represent a 2.2% contraction in earnings. Current year growth estimates are for 3.9%.\nIt's important to point out that next year's EPS growth looks better. In fact, over the last sixty days, analysts have increased their numbers for next year. That's pushed up the Zacks Consensus Estimate from $2.35 to $2.42. While next quarter could be a little rough, things are looking much better over the long term.\nInvestors looking for other stocks within the same industry with more favorable ranks are not going to find much. The best Zacks Rank in the industry is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nAdditional content:\n3 Tech Stocks for Dividend Investors to Buy\nTech stocks are likely to remain some of the most desirable on the market for years to come. But investors who want to be a part of the technology industry don't just have to search for high flying growth stocks. Instead, tech minded investors can take a page out of the income investing book and focus on companies with solid dividends.\nFinding a strong dividend yielding tech stock might seem difficult, but investors should not feel too intimidated. For example, Apple and some of the other biggest names in tech, pay dividends. And dividend focused investors can search for the best tech stocks by using the Zacks Stock Screener, which is a great one stop screening tool for investors of all kinds.\nBy limiting our search to companies in our \"Computer and Technology\" sector with Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or better rankings, we can ensure that we are finding the highest quality stocks to buy right now. Throw in your preferred dividend yield and you will find some of the best tech stocks for dividend investors to target.\nWith all that said, check out these three dividend paying tech stocks to buy right now:\n1. CDW Corporation\nCDW is a multi brand technology solutions powerhouse that works with enterprise level firms, governments, and more across the U.S., Canada, and the UK. The Lincolnshire, Illinois based company's portfolio is made up of over 1,000 brands and 100,000 products that range from security offerings to cloud computing solutions. CDW is coming off a better than projected first quarter of 2019 and has seen its stock price soar 37% in 2019. Shares of CDW opened at $106.48 on Thursday, not too far off their 52 week high.\nAlong with its strong first quarter and impressive price movement, CDW declared a new quarterly cash dividend of $0.295 per common share, which marked a 40% increase over last year's dividend. The tech firm currently pays a $1.18 annualized dividend, with a 1.12% yield. Looking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for the company's adjusted fiscal 2019 earnings to climb 11.6% on 7.3% revenue growth. Meanwhile, the firm's price/sales ratio of 0.92 marks an impressive discount compared to its industry's 2.15 average. And CDW has seen its earnings estimate revision activity trend completely upward recently for fiscal 2019 and 2020, which helps CDW earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The firm also sports an \"A\" grade for Momentum and \"Bs\" for both Value and Growth.\n2. Applied Materials, Inc.\nChip stocks got a boost earlier this week on optimism regarding a possible resolution to the ongoing U.S. China trade war. This helped lift shares of Applied Materials, which are now up roughly 31% in 2019. Despite the climb, AMAT stock still rests 14% below its 52 week high at $43.44 per share through late morning trading Thursday. Like many other chip firms, Applied Materials' 2019 earnings and revenue are projected to fall, thanks to a multitude of factors within the historically cyclical semiconductor industry\nDespite the current downturn, the semiconductor equipment maker's long term outlook is more positive. The firm's 2020 revenues are projected to jump 8.5% above our current year estimate to help lift earnings 18.3% higher than 2019's estimate. Meanwhile, AMAT's board recently approved a 5% increase to its quarterly cash dividend from $0.20 to $0.21 per share to help lift its yield to 1.98%. On top of that, Applied Materials' P/E of 14.29 matches its industry's average and its price/sales ratio of 2.52 represents a discount against its industry's 3.07. AMAT is Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now, based, in large part, on its positive longer term earnings estimate revision activity.\n3. Microsoft\nMicrosoft stock counties to hit new all time highs, which it did once again Thursday. Shares of MSFT are now up 37% in 2019 and touched $137.66 in morning trading. The tech titan is currently the world's most valuable public firm, with a market cap just over $1 trillion. Microsoft's legacy Windows and Office businesses have evolved and continue to drive growth. In recent years, however, MSFT's cloud computing unit has grabbed Wall Street's attention as the firm's division, highlighted by Azure, has turned Microsoft into the second largest cloud player behind only Amazon.\nIn recent weeks, Microsoft has detailed some of its plans to enter the nascent cloud gaming market in an effort to expand its video game strength for the next era, as Google aims to break in this fall. This includes a partnership with gaming rival Sony. MSFT's current full year earnings are projected to climb 18% on the back of 13.1% revenue growth. Microsoft has paid out a $0.46 per share quarterly dividend throughout fiscal 2019, for an annualized payout of $1.84 a share. Microsoft's current dividend represented a 9.5% jump from the prior year's quarterly payout, while its yield sits at 1.36%.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on CDW Corporation ( CDW Free Report ) , Applied Materials, Inc. ( AMAT Free Report ) and Microsoft ( MSFT Free Report ).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:\nBull of the Day :\nGuess what folks? The market is at all time highs. You can go ahead and rejoice now, thanking the FOMC for their upcoming easing. Now if we can get a trade deal done, there will be no stopping us at all. With all this momentum, it may feel like you can run out there and buy any stock that shows up on your computer screen. I'm going to warn you against that. Eventually, the momentum will die down and those stocks with strong earnings trends will hang in there. One way to find stocks with strong earnings trends is by leaning on the power of the Zacks Rank.\nToday's Bull of the Day is a stock in the good graces of the Zacks Rank. It's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) General Mills. General Mills, Inc. manufactures and markets branded consumer foods worldwide. The company operates in five segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice; Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet. It offers ready to eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit, and savory snacks, as well as organic products, including refrigerated yogurt, nutrition bars, meal kits, salty snacks, ready to eat cereal, and grain snacks.\nThe reason for the favorable rank lies in the series of earnings estimate revisions to the upside. Over the last thirty days, three analysts have increased their estimates for the current year and next year. The bullish sentiment has pushed up the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year to $3.15 while next year's number is up at $3.35.\nYou can see the strong move in earnings estimates on the Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart. Estimates bottomed out late last year, then began to move upwards. You can see the upswing in not only 2018 estimates, but also a nice trend higher for 2019 and 2020. The gaps between these lines shows the year over year growth upcoming as well.\nBear of the Day :\nFinally, the market is back to trading at all time highs. We can thank the FOMC for their contributions with their upcoming easing. Now if we can get a US China trade deal done, there will be no stopping us at all. With all this momentum, it may feel like you can run out there and buy any stock that shows up on your computer screen. I'm going to warn you against that. Eventually, the momentum will die down and those stocks with weak earnings trends will come under pressure. One way to avoid these weak trends is by leaning on the Zacks Rank. Those stocks with favorable Zacks Ranks have very strong earnings trends. Those with weak ranks, have been coming under pressure.\nToday's Bear of the Day is a stock with a weaker earnings trend. I'm talking about Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) Douglas Dynamics. Douglas Dynamics, Inc. operates as a manufacturer and upfitter of commercial work truck attachments and equipment primarily in North America. It operates in two segments, Work Truck Attachments and Work Truck Solutions. The Work Truck Attachments segment manufactures and sells snow and ice control attachments, including snowplows, and sand and salt spreaders for light and heavy duty trucks, as well as various related parts and accessories.\nThe Automotive \u2013 Replacement Parts industry is in the Bottom 14% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Douglas Dynamics is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The reason for the unfavorable rank lies in recent earnings estimate revisions to the downside coming from analysts. Looking at the next quarter number, analyst has dropped his number, bringing down our Zacks Consensus Estimate from 54 cents to 43 cents. That 43 cent number would represent a 2.2% contraction in earnings. Current year growth estimates are for 3.9%.\nIt's important to point out that next year's EPS growth looks better. In fact, over the last sixty days, analysts have increased their numbers for next year. That's pushed up the Zacks Consensus Estimate from $2.35 to $2.42. While next quarter could be a little rough, things are looking much better over the long term.\nInvestors looking for other stocks within the same industry with more favorable ranks are not going to find much. The best Zacks Rank in the industry is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nAdditional content:\n3 Tech Stocks for Dividend Investors to Buy\nTech stocks are likely to remain some of the most desirable on the market for years to come. But investors who want to be a part of the technology industry don't just have to search for high flying growth stocks. Instead, tech minded investors can take a page out of the income investing book and focus on companies with solid dividends.\nFinding a strong dividend yielding tech stock might seem difficult, but investors should not feel too intimidated. For example, Apple and some of the other biggest names in tech, pay dividends. And dividend focused investors can search for the best tech stocks by using the Zacks Stock Screener, which is a great one stop screening tool for investors of all kinds.\nBy limiting our search to companies in our \"Computer and Technology\" sector with Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or better rankings, we can ensure that we are finding the highest quality stocks to buy right now. Throw in your preferred dividend yield and you will find some of the best tech stocks for dividend investors to target.\nWith all that said, check out these three dividend paying tech stocks to buy right now:\n1. CDW Corporation\nCDW is a multi brand technology solutions powerhouse that works with enterprise level firms, governments, and more across the U.S., Canada, and the UK. The Lincolnshire, Illinois based company's portfolio is made up of over 1,000 brands and 100,000 products that range from security offerings to cloud computing solutions. CDW is coming off a better than projected first quarter of 2019 and has seen its stock price soar 37% in 2019. Shares of CDW opened at $106.48 on Thursday, not too far off their 52 week high.\nAlong with its strong first quarter and impressive price movement, CDW declared a new quarterly cash dividend of $0.295 per common share, which marked a 40% increase over last year's dividend. The tech firm currently pays a $1.18 annualized dividend, with a 1.12% yield. Looking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for the company's adjusted fiscal 2019 earnings to climb 11.6% on 7.3% revenue growth. Meanwhile, the firm's price/sales ratio of 0.92 marks an impressive discount compared to its industry's 2.15 average. And CDW has seen its earnings estimate revision activity trend completely upward recently for fiscal 2019 and 2020, which helps CDW earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The firm also sports an \"A\" grade for Momentum and \"Bs\" for both Value and Growth.\n2. Applied Materials, Inc.\nChip stocks got a boost earlier this week on optimism regarding a possible resolution to the ongoing U.S. China trade war. This helped lift shares of Applied Materials, which are now up roughly 31% in 2019. Despite the climb, AMAT stock still rests 14% below its 52 week high at $43.44 per share through late morning trading Thursday. Like many other chip firms, Applied Materials' 2019 earnings and revenue are projected to fall, thanks to a multitude of factors within the historically cyclical semiconductor industry\nDespite the current downturn, the semiconductor equipment maker's long term outlook is more positive. The firm's 2020 revenues are projected to jump 8.5% above our current year estimate to help lift earnings 18.3% higher than 2019's estimate. Meanwhile, AMAT's board recently approved a 5% increase to its quarterly cash dividend from $0.20 to $0.21 per share to help lift its yield to 1.98%. On top of that, Applied Materials' P/E of 14.29 matches its industry's average and its price/sales ratio of 2.52 represents a discount against its industry's 3.07. AMAT is Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now, based, in large part, on its positive longer term earnings estimate revision activity.\n3.

In recent years, however, MSFT's cloud computing unit has grabbed Wall Street's attention as the firm's division, highlighted by Azure, has turned Microsoft into the second largest cloud player behind only Amazon.\nIn recent weeks, Microsoft has detailed some of its plans to enter the nascent cloud gaming market in an effort to expand its video game strength for the next era, as Google aims to break in this fall. This includes a partnership with gaming rival Sony. MSFT's current full year earnings are projected to climb 18% on the back of 13.1% revenue growth. Microsoft has paid out a $0.46 per share quarterly dividend throughout fiscal 2019, for an annualized payout of $1.84 a share. Microsoft's current dividend represented a 9.5% jump from the prior year's quarterly payout, while its yield sits at 1.36%. MSFT is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that also rocks a \"B\" grade for Growth and an \"A\" for Momentum.\nWill you retire a millionaire? One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire.

In BGP route tables, ISPs are identified by an AS (Autonomous System) number.\nSEE: 10 tips for new cybersecurity pros (free PDF)\nA problem with the system is that it's difficult to know for sure whether a BGP hijacking event is actually malicious or just an accident. Researchers have in the past identified highly suspicious events because traffic from major companies like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google was wrongly rerouted. The other sign is the location and reputation of the ISP that caused it.\nOther times, it's more clear cut that an event is malicious, but internet infrastructure providers can still be wrongly routing traffic according to an attacker's plan for hours before they can rectify the problem.\nThe US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is working on a proposal that could thwart many BGP hijacking events.\nIt involves Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to allow cloud providers and ISPs that hold blocks of internet addresses to control which networks can announce a direct connection to their address block.\nIt's also working on BGP Validation so that routers can use RPKI information to filter out unauthorized BGP route announcements.\nResearchers at MIT are working on the detection side of the problem using a machine learning model to \"automatically identify Autonomous Systems (ASes) that exhibit characteristics similar to serial hijackers.\"\nThe gist of the effort is to help network operators proactively respond to ISPs that have a track record for bad behavior rather than only reacting to events after they happen. As it is, network operators can only publicly call out bad behavior in network engineering mailing lists and hope other networks help correct the issue.\n\"Current hijack detection systems typically rely on assumptions of prefix ownership and track origin changes in the global routing table. If an event is detected, the victim network can react and attempt to get in contact with the perpetrator or its upstream networks to solve the problem,\" the MIT researchers explain in a paper 'Profiling BGP Serial Hijackers: Capturing Persistent Misbehavior in the Global Routing Table', which they'll present later this month in Amsterdam.\n\"However, many times this contact is not fruitful or not even possible. At that point, victims of hijacks are only left with the option of publicly disclosing the event in network operator mailing lists in the hope that peer pressure and manual interventions by other networks, such as filtering announcements or refusing to provide transit, will remediate the situation.\"\nThe researchers built the machine learning detection model based on the assertion that malicious BGP behavior by an actor is sometimes consistent over time. By analyzing actions over time, the researchers aimed to create a scoring system to indicate an operator's good or bad reputation.\nThe serial BGP hijackers they focus on are the ASes that have displayed malicious activity in the global routing table for several years.\n\"We take on a new perspective on illicit BGP activity: instead of looking at individual BGP hijacking events, we study the long term prefix advertisement dynamics in the global routing table in space and time.\"\nSpecifically, they looked at BGP announcement dynamics of serial hijacker ASes over five years in a bid to identify characteristics that separate them from well behaved ASes.\nSEE: Dear network operators, please use the existing tools to fix security\nOne of the serial hijackers in the study, AS197426, or BitCanal, was \"effectively cut off from the global internet\" last July, according to Oracle owned Dyn. The Portuguese company was described by a security researcher as a BGP \"hijack factory\" because of its persistent hijacking activity over the years.\nThe classifier also identified AS19529 as a hijacker network and AS134190 as a network that shows the most recent indications of potential serial hijacker behavior.\nWith this knowledge, it would be possible for network operators to deploy systems to automatically discard bad BGP routing announcements rather than relying on mailing lists.\nBut they also note possible problems with autonomous detection. For example, companies that provide protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are what they call 'benign serial hijackers' because the process of scrubbing DDoS traffic involves BGP hijacking.

The Office app provides a simple, integrated experience that puts the tools you need for working on a mobile device at the forefront of the experience. We started by combining the existing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint mobile apps into a single app. Doing so brings all of your Office documents together in one place, reduces the need to switch between multiple apps, and significantly reduces the amount of space used on your phone compared to multiple installed apps. We then added new capabilities that harness the strengths of mobile devices, such as the camera, to enable you to create content in uniquely mobile ways. Finally, we added a new Actions Pane that helps you accomplish many of the common mobile tasks you need to do all from one place. Camera integration lets you easily convert photos of documents and tables into Word and Excel files, while PowerPoint presentations can easily import photos from your camera roll. The new Actions pane supports a number of common tasks like creating PDFs from documents or photos, signing PDFs with your finger, scanning QR codes, and file transfers. Office for mobile is available in public preview today, with the iOS preview running through Apple's TestFlight program and limited to the first 10,000 users. Users can gets basic access to the preview with no sign in required, but if you log in with a work, school, or personal Microsoft account you'll get access to all of your cloud based documents. The new Office app is currently only avaliable for phones, but it will be extended to tablets in the future, and Microsoft says it will continue to support and improve its existing standalone Office mobile apps.Tag: Microsoft Office This article, \"Microsoft Introduces Unified Office App for iOS and Android\" first appeared on MacRumors.com Discuss this article in our forums", "URL": "https://www.onenewspage.com/n/Computer+Industry/1zkkon44hz/Microsoft-Introduces-Unified-Office-App-for-iOS-and.htm"}, {"Title": "Opinion: Samsung and Microsoft partnership highlights blended device world", "Text": "The partnership signifies a profound shift in the landscape of devices, companies, platforms, and capabilities. By bringing together Samsung branded hardware and Microsoft software and services, the two companies have formed a powerful juggernaut that represents a serious threat to Apple and an oblique challenge to Google, particularly in the enterprise market.\nTo be clear, the companies have worked together in the past and some have argued that the exact details of the partnership remain to be flushed out. Fair enough. But when you put together the number one smartphone market share presence of Samsung with the deeply entrenched position of Microsoft software and cloud based services, it's not hard to imagine a lot of very interesting possibilities that could grow out of the new arrangement.\nFor one, it helps each company overcome long running concerns that they've been missing out on important markets. Samsung has been chided for not having the software and services expertise and offerings of an Apple, which was theoretically going to make the Korean giant vulnerable as the hardware markets started to slow. On the other side, Microsoft rather notoriously failed to make any kind of dent in the smartphone market. Together, however, the complementary capabilities offered by the partnership give customers a wide range of powerful and attractive devices, along with leading edge services and software in the business world. Plus, the two companies don't really compete, making the collaboration that much more compelling. The consumer story is clearly much tougher, but even there, Microsoft's forthcoming game streaming services could certainly be an intriguing and compelling option for certain consumers. On top of that, the combination of Samsung and Microsoft is likely to attract interest from other third party consumer services (Spotify or Netflix anyone?) that would be interested in joining the party. \"When you put together the number one smartphone market share presence of Samsung with the deeply entrenched position of Microsoft software and cloud based services, it's not hard to imagine a lot of very interesting possibilities that could grow out of the new arrangement.\"\nBut there are additional benefits to the partnership as well. For one, it clearly helps tie PCs and smartphones together in a much more capable and blended way. To Apple's credit, their Continuity features that link iPhones, iPads and Macs in an organized fashion were the first to make multiple devices operate as a single entity. However, despite Apple's overall strength, the percentage of people who only own Apple devices is actually pretty small\u2014in the single digit percentage range according to my research. The percentage of people who have Windows PCs and Android based phones, on the other hand, is enormous. Obviously, Samsung only owns a portion of that total, but it's a big enough percentage to make for a very significant competitor.\nMore importantly, the combination of Microsoft and Samsung also further breaks down the walls between different operating systems and highlights the value the cloud can bring to a multi device, multi platform world. Samsung is still committed to Google's Android as its smartphone OS, but by integrating things like Office 365, OneDrive and more into its devices, they are making life easier for people who spend much of their time in the Windows world. Conversely, Microsoft's expanding efforts with their Your Phone app in Windows 10 highlight the effort they're making to turn the process of using multiple devices into a more coherent experience. Unique Samsung specific extensions promised for that app should make it even more compelling. For Google, the challenge will be continuing to build the presence of apps like G Suite and other enterprise focused services in spite of its leading Android partner choosing Microsoft for some of its business based offerings.\nThe deal extends beyond smartphones as well. Though Samsung has been tiny player in the Windows PC market for several years, they made a bit of a splash at the event by introducing the Samsung Galaxy Book , the first Windows based always connected PC (ACPC) using Qualcomm's third generation PC focused processor the 8CX. While there are clearly still challenges in that space, the fact that it's a Samsung, Microsoft, Qualcomm partnership in PCs exemplifies again how far the tech industry has evolved over the last several years.\nWe're clearly still in the very early days of analyzing what the potential impact of the Samsung and Microsoft partnership will mean. But even a casual glance would suggest that there are very interesting things still to come.

Developers have been playing with the platform for the past couple of months and attendees at E3 also got to go hands on with the new technology. The service will allow users to use their own Xbox as a game server, or use Microsoft's Xbox powered cloud platform to stream Xbox One games to a PC, TV, smartphone or tablet at home or on the go.\n\"Two months ago we connected all Xbox developers to Project xCloud,\" Xbox boss Phil Spencer told the E3 audience. The Xbox One streaming service will \"turn your Xbox One into your own personal and free xCloud server.\" \"On team Xbox, every decision is guided by the belief that gaming is for everyone,\" Spencer added. \"This is why we keep innovating hardware and services, and it's why we're uniting communities through cross play.\"\nMicrosoft hasn't revealed whether xCloud will cost additional money to activate, or whether it will be bundled into its Xbox Live subscriptions. As gamers will be streaming their own titles, and not subscribing to a gaming catalog as such, it is possible it could be a free value added service.

Air New Zealand's fleet of more than 100 aircraft range in size from the 50 seat Bombardier Q300 to the Boeing 777 300ER.\nEast Aurora, NY, Moog Inc. (NYSE: MOG.A and MOG.B) today announced a world first experiment conducted in conjunction with Microsoft, Air New Zealand, and ST Engineering which has the potential to transform aerospace supply chains by leveraging 3D printing and Moog's blockchain enabled VeriPart process to create a point of use, time of need digital supply chain.\nThe proof of concept has seen Air New Zealand order a digital aircraft part file from Singapore based ST Engineering. The digital file was immediately sent to an approved printer, operated by Moog in Los Angeles, downloaded and 3D printed before being installed on an Air New Zealand Boeing 777 300 aircraft within hours of its scheduled departure. The entire transaction, from purchase to installation, was logged in Moog's VeriPart digital supply chain system, which is powered by Microsoft Azure Cloud technology.\nThe file was for a bumper part, which sits behind the airline's Business Premier monitors and prevents the screen from damaging the seat when it's pushed in.\nVeriPart is used for assuring data, process, and performance integrity of 3D printed parts for aerospace applications. The VeriPart blockchain platform allows an engineering partner to release its intellectual property in a controlled way. The airline is then only able to 3D print the number of parts it requires on demand. The newly printed part is securely authenticated and traceable via VeriPart, providing the added value of configuration control for the life of the aircraft.\nThis four company experiment has made it possible to prove the concept as technically viable and prove its potential value to the aircraft maintenance industry. The end result of the collaboration opens the door to a future of distributed networks starting with a digital design file and ending with a physical part. This will decrease lead times and result in less down time for airlines.\nTo view a video about this ground breaking digital experiment, visit: www.veripart.com.\nAbout Moog\nMoog Inc. is a worldwide designer, manufacturer, and integrator of precision control components and systems.

Enterprises considering SD WAN should understand how the design impacts total costs, network reliability, application performance, and service level promises. The good news is that your choices are no longer limited to expensive MPLS networks or unreliable Internet based VLANs. Appliance Centric Design The first type of SD WAN design is the appliance based pure overlay, which uses an on premises router. This unit often replaces the standard site router at smaller offices or is a software feature activated in an edge router. In this design, the SD WAN router leverages whatever WAN connections are provisioned \u2013 it's agnostic about the uplinks. The unit will provide traffic shaping, prioritizing real time protocols and latency sensitive data, and will seek the best performance pathway among the WAN links. In many cases, the SD WAN appliance is sold as a way to move from expensive MPLS circuits to a combination of standard ISP circuits. However, the SD WAN router allows a customer to choose the WAN connectivity, including leaving one link as MPLS while providing an alternate to improve reliability (failover) or to increase total bandwidth. Using a non telco provider such as a cable provider or a 4G LTE wireless link can provide local loop protection. It's important to note that with each of these WAN link options there can be disadvantages. A design that leaves in the deterministic MPLS circuit is unlikely to save money, although the SD WAN performance and failover advantages may be more important than simply costs. Using a combination of ISP links, however, may save money, but it's reliant upon the open \"best effort\" Internet, which cannot provide any assurance that the best available ISP link chosen by the SD WAN router is going to always perform acceptably. The wireless 4G link may incur usage charges, even when it's only from test packets, and the upstream handoff is usually the open Internet. Cloud Gateway Design To combat the performance concerns raised by relying upon standard Internet connections, some SD WAN providers have established a cloud based gateway for the on premises router to use as the uplink. This design allows the provider to enhance overall performance by using peering arrangements and direct backbone connections to key cloud services such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Salesforce.com, etc. Many of these providers also offer or link to real time communications services, including voice and video, as part of the directly connected services. All of the previously described SD WAN benefits and options remain in place, but now using standard Internet links (at a lower cost) does not carry as much risk of negative impact from uncontrolled Internet events. A detailed example of how one vendor, Juniper Networks, has combined the on site SD WAN router with gateway services is explained in this No Jitter post by UC analyst Zeus Kerravala. Carrier Based SD WAN The third SD WAN design is carrier centric. The on site SD WAN appliance is not the key here, although some router functions still help control the client side access and uplink choices. The router will connect the local loops to the nearest carrier point of presence, where the carrier can separate out the standard Internet traffic. All corporate and critical traffic is delivered across the carrier backbone, which can provide low levels of latency, packet loss, and jitter. Like the gateway design above, the carrier backbone is also directly connected with major cloud application providers to increase the performance and reliability of those applications. Although some enterprises may feel carrier diversity has its benefits, it's also common for some customers to stay with their existing carrier to help with the technology migration or to enable a smooth contract transition. Costs may be higher, but better service level agreements are often available to support the performance promises. Which Design Is Best? Of course, no single design implementation is right for everyone. The best approach is to understand the different options and to engage with different supplier choices before making a commitment. Also keep in mind that even with similar designs, there will be differences in service offerings from the various providers. Lessons learned from peers sharing their experiences can be helpful as well.

military and veterans are transforming their lives as they learn their way toward new careers in information technology by joining the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA) program , now offered at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University's campus at Schofield Barracks in Hawai'i.\n\"Education has opened doors for me throughout my life,\" said U.S. Marine Corps Major General Chris Cortez (Ret.), vice president of Microsoft Military Affairs. \"Programs like MSSA allow transitioning service members and veterans to unlock their full potential and find fulfillment in civilian careers in the technology industry.\"\nIn partnership with Microsoft, Embry Riddle offers MSSA and educates America's military service members and veterans at 13 locations across the United States. Graduates have gained invaluable IT skills as server and cloud administrators, cloud applications developers and cybersecurity administrators. The program provides technical knowledge and hands on capabilities, and teaches professional skills needed to land a career in the private sector.\nAmong Schofield Barracks' inaugural Server & Cloud Administrator cohort, nearly half of the participants plan to go on to an associate or bachelor's degree to further their careers. Most MSSA participants did not work in IT before they came to the program; some are already pursuing degrees in IT related fields; others want solid IT know how as they pursue degrees in non IT fields.\nEli Ellison\nWhen Eli Ellison was preparing to transition out of the U.S. Army in 2016, he heard about the possibility of earning certifications via the MSSA program.\nHaving worked in a wide range of IT and communications functions for the military, Ellison learned that he could earn a bachelor's degree in Technical Management at Embry Riddle while also participating in the MSSA program.\nNot quite three years later, Ellison, 30, has graduated from Embry Riddle and is working as an associate incident response coordinator at Community Health Systems in Nashville.\n\"I believe that getting my degree at Embry Riddle helped me be more competitive in the workplace,\" Ellison said. \"Employers see Embry Riddle on my resume and remark that it is a good school. And the MSSA program has helped tremendously in preparing me for interviews and how to job hunt, as well as opening up communication with great organizations.\"\nJoseph Lahmon\nA participant who is just starting the MSSA program at Schofield Barracks, Joseph Lahmon, said he has chosen to concurrently finish his bachelor's degree with Embry Riddle for two reasons.\nThe first reason, he said, is to \"complete what has been a long and challenging journey toward education.\" The second is \"loyalty to an institution that has had nothing but my best interests in mind since the very first day I walked into their office. I have been working towards this degree for more than five years through deployments, field operations, and the birth and raising of my three children. I can see the finish line now and am eager to finish with Embry Riddle.\"\nThe MSSA program, Lahmon said, \"will serve to make me not only more knowledgeable and competent in the field but many times more competitive when looking for a career in IT.\"\nLahmon's wife is an active duty Marine. \"My role as her spouse (and a former Marine) is to support her career while also developing my own,\" he said. \"When I complete this program, the first thing I will do is take my wife and children out to celebrate, as they have endured as much as I during this process. And then I will seek employment with a reputable organization that places great emphasis upon finding a balance between family and work.\"\nMSSA started operating in 2013 and has been available at Embry Riddle Worldwide campuses since 2016. As part of the intensive 18 week program, participants earn 15 to 18 academic credits toward a Technical Management associate or bachelor's degree. They are also guaranteed a job interview at Microsoft or one of its more than 500 hiring partners, many that are Fortune 500 companies. The average salary of the program's graduates is $75,000.\nThe program has a graduation rate that is over ninety three percent, according to Angela Albritton, Embry Riddle director of military relations and strategic initiatives, and ninety five percent of MSSA graduates are employed.\nAs an education partner for MSSA, Embry Riddle provides online learning, classrooms, virtual labs, presentations, hands on exercises and testing.\n\"This partnership with Microsoft has been incredibly successful, and we are proud to be part of the effort to train members of our nation's military for valuable IT careers,\" said Embry Riddle Worldwide Chancellor Dr. John R.

(wba)\nThe technology company and Walgreens on Tuesday announced a seven year agreement under which Microsoft will provide cloud services to its new partner, the second largest pharmacy chain in the U.S. behind CVS Health (cvs) with nearly 10,000 stores, by migrating most of its tech infrastructure to Microsoft Azure. The companies cited the complexities of the American healthcare as a new area of opportunity.\n\"Improving health outcomes while lowering the cost of care is a complex challenge that requires broad collaboration and strong partnership between the health care and tech industries,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a statement. The companies said they would jointly conduct research to develop health care services. Later this year, Walgreens will pilot \"digital health corners\" at as many as 12 of its stores.\nWalgreens joins Walmart , Kroger and Gap Inc among major retailers to have recently announced partnerships with Microsoft, whose Azure, as Fortune's Adam Lashinsky put it in an article on Tuesday, is at the nexus of Microsoft's \"intelligent edge\" strategy wherein every product and service aims to strengthen Azure, its growth engine.\nAmazon has also been making moves into healthcare, though its overall intentions remain unclear. Last summer, the company said it was buying online pharmacy PillPack in a deal estimated at $1 billion aimed at giving it a platform through which to sell pharmaceuticals. The company has also teamed up with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to eventually create a new health care company to redesign health care provided to their employees. Meanwhile, CVS, which recently closed a deal to buy insurer Aetna , has said it would turn large areas in some stores into health clinics. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT", "URL": "http://fortune.com/2019/01/15/microsoft-walgreens/"}, {"Title": "Walgreens teams with Microsoft to battle Amazon - News", "Text": "By Cynthia Koonsand Dina BassBloomberg Tuesday Jan 15, 2019 at 5:05 PM Jan 15, 2019 at 5:05 PM\nWalgreens Boots Alliance is teaming with Microsoft to design \"digital health corners\" for its stores as both companies battle an ever expanding Amazon.com.\nFor Walgreens, the pharmacy giant must contend with looming competitive threats from Amazon and other upstarts looking to disrupt the drugstore business. Microsoft, meanwhile, is angling to gain ground against Amazon Web Services by offering back end computing muscle to retail, grocery and health operators that don't want to give more business to one of their biggest foes.\nAs part of the accord, Walgreens will begin using Microsoft's Azure cloud computing software, moving applications and data to the tech giant's data centers, the companies said. For Microsoft, it's the second major Azure centered deal with a retail chain this month, following a pact with grocer Kroger Co. last week.\nWalgreens has forged a series of agreements designed to insulate it from a rapidly evolving health care and retail landscape. After rival CVS Health Corp. agreed to buy health insurer Aetna Inc., Walgreens set up a senior health clinic joint venture with insurer Humana Inc. And to ramp up its technological and e commerce sophistication, it has inked deals with Verily Life Sciences, a unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc., and cosmetics retailer Birchbox.\n\"Health care is too complicated, too big and, if I can say, a little too messy,\" Walgreens Chief Executive Officer Stefano Pessina said in an interview. \"We cannot be helpful to our patients if we don't team up with many, many different, practically all, the players in this industry.\"\nThe deal with Microsoft will start with a pilot of digital health corners in as many as 12 stores this year, which will be designed to promote the sale of health related devices and help patients manage chronic diseases.\nMicrosoft has made earlier forays into health software before pulling back. For the past two years, it has been working on cloud and artificial intelligence products that can be used to reduce data entry tasks for doctors, triage patients and provide more targeted cancer care. This time, Microsoft is aiming to partner with health companies rather than competing with them, as well as getting them to use Azure.\n\"One of the core challenges in health care is a little bit the fragmentation of the data, but also when you say 'Let's bring it all together,' it's important to remember that this is a regulated industry and users deeply care about their privacy,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. \"We are doing a lot of work on how can you uphold the promise but also be compliant with all the regulations.\"\nFinancial terms weren't disclosed. The two have committed to a multiyear research and development investment to develop other health care tools that could ultimately lower costs. The companies may establish joint innovation centers in some markets.\nBesides being a win for Azure, the deal involves a commitment by Walgreens to use Microsoft 365 \u2014 a collection of software that includes Windows 10, Office cloud services and security and mobile management software \u2014 for the drugstore's more than 380,000 workers.", "URL": "https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190115/walgreens-teams-with-microsoft-to-battle-amazon?rssfeed=true"}]}, {"client": "THE METHODIST HOSPITAL | GB0009R5", "industry": "Healthcare", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 53.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "STATE OF MICHIGAN | GB0009RY", "industry": "Education", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 384.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft System Center OpsMgr, Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Strong", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "3M | GB0009T0", "industry": "Industrial Products", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 195.0, "market": "US", "products": "Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage, Microsoft System Center OpsMgr, Azure Data Factory, Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Neutral", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD OF MN | GB0009TN", "industry": "Healthcare", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 9.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "ALTRIA GROUP | GB0009UU", "industry": "Consumer Products", "segment": "Industry", "intensity": 280.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft Azure, Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Strong", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "STATE OF NEW YORK | GB000A1B", "industry": "Healthcare", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 1701.0, "market": "US", "products": "Azure IoT, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft System Center OpsMgr, Microsoft System Center", "score": 12.0, "relationshipStrength": "Strong", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": [{"Title": "Poly launches Studio X series for Microsoft Teams", "Text": "Poly launches Studio X series for Microsoft Teams Published on 06/11/2019 Unified Communications\nPlantronics will introduce video conferencing devices with a built in Microsoft Teams experience at Microsoft Ignite 2019 this week.

The partnership highlights the emergence of an \"industry cloud\" in the financial services industry where fintech, or financial technology, also has become an important trend, IDC President Crawford Del Prete told Business Insider. \"JPMorgan will use their strength in understanding different fintech use cases, and therefore attract developers to address these problems, as they are known by so many of these developers,\" he said. \"Blockchain will be critical in reducing friction in markets and or transactions,\" he added. \"Obviously financial services has many of these kinds of transactions where a distributed ledger technology can be used to, for example, reduce the amount of time it takes to settle a specific transaction between financial institutions.\" Addtional reporting by Senior Tech Editor Matt Weinberger.

iHeartMedia, Nvidia and Microsoft highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day", "Text": "For Immediate Release\nChicago, IL \u2013 November 25, 2019 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research Zendesk ZEN as the Bull of the Day, iHeartMedia IHRT as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Nvidia NVDA and Microsoft MSFT.\nHere is a synopsis of all four stocks:\nBull of the Day :\nZendesk is hot right now with a rally of more than 20% in the last month and almost 50% returns in the past 52 weeks. The flame that ignited this most recent rally was ZEN's Q3 earnings, which demonstrated a big top and bottom line beat. The firm showed investors year over year topline growth of 36% and achieved an annual revenue run rate of more than $800 million. The latest earnings further grew analysts' optimism about ZEN and propelled this stock into a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nZendesk is a cloud based platform that helps businesses improve their customer experience. The company started as a customer support cloud, and now with Zendesk Sunshine, it has become a complete customer relationship management platform (CRM). Zendesk initially catered to growing small to mid sized businesses (SMB) who were just beginning to have significant customer relations issues. Today the company services an increasing number of Fortune 500 enterprises.\nThe platform provides businesses with omnichannel solutions so that they can meet their customers' needs in a way that is most convenient to the customer. Zendesk has helped connect nearly 900 million customer queries with a solution in the past year.\nWhy ZEN?\nIn this digital age we the markets have seen a plethora of CRM platforms, so what makes Zendesk worth investing in?\nZendesk focusses on ease of implantation and use, with all the sophisticated software being handled on the backend. You don't need a professional to help integrate like you would with salesforce.com.\nThe platform is open and cloud based, meaning that you can access it wherever and whenever you want. It also is easily integrated into other enterprise software.\nGartner has recognized Zendesk as the Magical Quadrant leader in CRM Customer Service Centers for 3 years running. In a press release regarding this award the firm expressed their thoughts about this award means. \"With one of the fastest growing customer bases of any vendor, Zendesk believes it was recognized for its overall value proposition, ease of set up, usability, API integration and rapid adoption.\"\nThe companies balance sheet is healthy, with $427 million in cash and positive cash flows from operations that have progressively grown. Zendesk is expected to continue growing its top line by more than 30% for the next couple of years.\n14 out of 16 sell side analysts are calling ZEN a buy right now (no sell ratings), with an average target price that would represent a 20% upside.\nTake Away\nZendesk is still yet to turn a profit, which makes this investment riskier, and with a beta over 1 this stock will not provide you with any market hedge. This being said, I think ZEN has excellent long term potential and a proven business model that I believe will continue to appreciate its share price.\nZEN is trading 17% below its 52 week high, but with the recent rally and momentum behind these shares, new highs could be reached soon.\nBear of the Day :\niHeartMedia, the #1 audio media company in the US, has emerged from bankruptcy, and its ownership is now available to the public on the NASDAQ exchange, but are they worth buying? Analysts have continued to drop their expectations as this medium progressively loses popularity, and costs grow faster than revenues. IHRT currently sits at a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\nIHRT closed its first day back on the market at $18 in the beginning of May and has since fallen over 15%. Its most recent earnings illustrating an enormous EPS miss, and a 10% viewership decline from the year prior. I fear that these shares may have a further downside ahead of them.\nThe Bankruptcy\niHeartMedia filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 14th, 2018, and finally rose from this strenuous restructuring on May 1st of this year. Bond owners and lenders have since taken control of the company from private equity firms Bain Capital Partners and Thomas H. Lee Partners. This transfer of control was headed by Franklin Advisers, leaving both the CEO and CFO in their current positions.\nThis firm's downfall into bankruptcy was due to a few key factors. The first being the timing of the leveraged buyout by Bain and Lee, which occurred on the brink of the 2008 credit crisis. This buyout put roughly $20 billion in debt on iHeartMedia's balance sheet at a time when both advertising revenues were plummeting, and extensive lines of credit were hard to come by.\nThe second contribution to this media behemoth's downfall is advertisers' opportunity cost with more engaging platforms. Advertisers don't typically see the same return on investment from radio ads compared to say a personalized Google or Facebook ad.\nThis depreciating return on ads over the airwaves has led to a depreciating willingness to pay by firms. Costs for iHeartMedia have been growing, but unfortunately, revenues haven't been able to keep up.\nThe excessive $1.48 billion annual interest expense was hemorrhaging funds from the company, and when $16.4 billion in debt matured, they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy.\niHeart's reorganization involved a spinoff of its outdoor advertising company, rebranded as Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings. This allows the firm to focus on its higher margin core radio business.\nCan iHeartMedia Come Out of the Ashes?\nThe company owns 848 live broadcast radio stations, six times its closest competitor. The US radio advertising market is sitting at $15.9 billion, according to PwC, but this figure isn't expected to see much growth in the coming years. iHeartMedia is going to have to leverage their digital radio streaming platform to capture needed growth moving forward.\niHeartMedia's digital segment makes up only 7% of the firm's topline but is responsible for most of its topline growth. The digital radio streaming is expected to grow 23% over the next three years. With increasing expenses at seemingly every corner, this small topline driver may not be enough to keep IHRT afloat.\nThe main issue with iHeartRadio is that its primary revenue drivers are coming from a declining market. We are living in a digitalized world, and traditional radio is losing viewership. Advertisers' willingness to pay is progressively declining, with no expectations of growth. iHeart owns most of the US's radio networks, but in a space with shrinking margins and a falling user base, this is not an easily leverageable offering.\nTake Away\nThe media behemoth has finally risen out of the ashes of chapter 11 bankruptcy, but the question is whether they have eliminated the systemic issues that led them there. They are keeping both the current CEO and CFO in place, which causes me some concern over a potential lack of constructive changes.\nCEO Bob Pittman is quoted after the bell this morning saying, \"We've had a very good operating business but our capital structure was not in good shape.\" This is not the full story considering the shrinking margins that iHeart has been experiencing was one of the bankruptcy catalysts.\niHeartMedia is the leader of a dying media channel, and I fear that without a substantial strategy pivot, the company may be headed right back into bankruptcy.\n3 Tech Stocks for Growth Investors to Buy Now\nAll three major U.S. indexes climbed in morning trading Friday on the back of some U.S. China trade war positivity. This came after Chinese President Xi Jinping reportedly called for Beijing and Washington to improve communication, as the two sides try to reach a so called phase one trade deal.\nThe S&P 500, Dow, and the Nasdaq all rest within 1% of their record highs that they reached earlier in the week. Despite the trade uncertainty, which has been the story for a long time, Wall Street has clearly been pleased enough with better than feared quarterly earnings results, solid U.S. jobs and consumer data, and a third Fed interest rate cut.\nWith this in mind, investors should take the time to look for a few growth focused stocks. Now let's dive into three tech stocks that we found with our Zacks Stock Screener that growth investors might want to consider buying right now as the stock market remains near its new highs \nNvidia\nNvidia posted its fourth straight quarter of declining sales and earnings on November 14. The GPU powerhouse fell victim to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and its own outsized success. Yet, NVDA shares are up 30% in the last three months and 60% in 2019\u2014to outpace Micron and Intel\u2014as investors see the comeback on the horizon. Despite the climb, Nvidia stock still rests roughly 25% below its October 2018 highs, which could give the stock plenty of room to run.\nNVDA's fourth quarter fiscal 2020 revenue is projected to surge 34% to help lift adjusted earnings by 107%, based on our Zacks estimates. Meanwhile, the firm's adjusted full year fiscal 2021 earnings are projected to jump 30% on the back of over 19% higher sales that would see it reach $12.86 billion.\nNvidia has seen its longer term earnings revision picture trend heavily upward to help it earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment. Nvidia also sports a \"B\" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system and its Semiconductor \u2013 General industry rests in the top 19% of our more than 250 Zacks industries. And the Santa Clara, California headquarter firm is set to benefit from the long term expansion of high end gaming, as well as data centers, cloud computing, 5G, and artificial intelligence.\nZendesk, Inc.\nZendesk is a software as a service firm focused on customer service and engagement, offering an array of products and services. The company, which boasts roughly 150,000 paid customer accounts, posted stronger than projected top and bottom line results in late October. ZEN's Q3 fiscal 2019 revenue surged 36%, while adjusted earnings jumped from $0.05 in the year ago period to $0.12 per share\u2014which crushed our estimate by 100%.\nZendesk has a $8.8 billion market cap, an average volume of over 2 million, a \"B\" grade for Growth, and is part of our Internet \u2013 Software industry that is currently in the top 35% of our 254 Zacks industries. Zendesk shares have surged 18% since the firm reported its results on October 29. The stock is now up 48% in the past 12 months and 250% in the last three years, which blows away its industry's 47% climb. In spite of the climb, ZEN still rests roughly 15% off its 52 week highs.\nThe San Francisco based firm's adjusted Q4 earnings are projected to pop 10% on the back of 32.3% higher sales. The company's full year fiscal 2019 EPS figure is expected to soar 41% to $0.31 per share, with sales expected to pop 36% to reach $813.2 million. Peeking further ahead, ZEN's fiscal 2020 sales are projected to climb another 30.5% to reach $1.06 billion, with earnings expected to skyrocket over 90% higher to $0.59 per share. ZEN's strong earnings revisions help it hold a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it looks poised to climb as part of the continued digital transformation of businesses around the globe.\nMicrosoft\nThe last stock on the list today is by far the most well known, which might make some investors think its growth days are over. But Microsoft, under CEO Satya Nadella, who took over in February 2014, has seen its stock soar 213% in the past five years, after it moved mostly sideways for the better part of 15 years. MSFT stock has also climbed nearly 50% in 2019 to take its place in the $1 trillion market cap club alongside only Apple.\nMicrosoft's resurgence rests largely on its cloud computing expansion that now sees it compete directly against industry leader Amazon. For example, Microsoft's Q1 fiscal 2020 sales jumped 14% on the back of 27% expansion in its Intelligent Cloud unit. The Redmond, Washington headquartered firm has also continued to innovate within Office, Windows, and devices, as it continues to make key acquisitions such as LinkedIn and GitHub.\nLooking ahead, Microsoft's sales are projected to pop 11% in both fiscal 2020 and 2021. Meanwhile, MSFT's adjusted full year EPS figures are expected to surge 12.3% in each of the next two years. MSFT, which consistently tops quarterly estimates, is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company is also part of an industry that rests in the top 17% right now. And Microsoft executives announced in September that the firm raised its quarterly dividend by 11% and approved a new share repurchase program.\nLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?\nZacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.\nIgnited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

Nokia is bringing its networking capabilities, which span IoT, SD WAN and 5G, into Microsoft's cloud solutions to help drive enterprises' digital transformations, while enabling service providers to offer new services to their enterprise customers.\nLanding the deal with Microsoft was a big win for Nokia. Its competitors include Cisco, Ericsson and Huawei.\nMicrosoft's Azure, Azure IoT, Azure AI and machine learning solutions are being blended into Nokia's LTE and 5G ready private wireless solutions, IP, SD WAN, and IoT connectivity offerings.\nThe two companies said their collaborative effort would drive the adoption of the fourth industry revolution, which is known as Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 uses automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes that include cyber physical systems, the internet of things (IoT), industrial internet of things (IIOT), cloud computing, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\nRELATED: Nokia forms partnership to boost Industry 4.0 adoption in Brazil\n\"Bringing together Microsoft's and Nokia's expertise in cloud, AI, IoT and networking will unlock new connectivity and automation scenarios,\" said Jason Zander, executive vice president, Microsoft Azure, in a statement \"We're excited about the opportunities this will create for our joint customers across industries.\"\nThe Nokia Digital Automation Cloud (Nokia DAC) 5G ready industrial grade private wireless broadband platform will be upgraded with on premise Azure elements. Those Azure enhancements will enable a variety of secure industrial automation solutions that require more reliable connectivity, efficient coverage and better mobility than traditional Wi Fi networks provide.\nRELATED: SD WAN vendor Silver Peak deepens its relationship with Microsoft's cloud services\nIn a similar vein to SD WAN announcements this week with Cisco and Silver Peak, Nokia's Nuage SD WAN 2.0 will allow service providers to offer integration with Microsoft Azure Virtual WAN for branch to cloud connectivity, with the companies planning to offer more options for branch internet connectivity next year.\nBT is the first global service provider to offer its enterprise customers a managed service that melds Microsoft Azure cloud with Nokia's Nuage SD WAN technology. BT customers can access the service via Microsoft Lighthouse customer automated delegated rights service, which enables BT to manage both the customer Azure vWAN and the Agile Connect SD WAN that is based on Nokia's Nuage SD WAN 2.0.\nThe two companies are also blending Nokia's Worldwide IoT Network Grid (WING) with Azure IoT Central to make the on boarding, deployment, management and servicing of IoT solutions seamless. Enterprises will be able to use Azure IoT Central and partner solutions for faster and easier enablement and implementation of their IoT applications in conjunction with Nokia's IoT connectivity solutions.\nMicrosoft and Nokia are also working on putting Nokia's Analytics, Virtualization, and Automation cognitive services platform on Microsoft's Azure cloud. Those AI solutions will help service providers to move out of private data centers and into the Azure cloud to cut costs and transform operations for 5G. Nokia cited predictive Video Analytics is an example of a joint solution that will ensure optimal video experience for CSP subscribers, improving reliability by up to 60%.\n\"We are thrilled to unite Nokia's mission critical networks with Microsoft's cloud solutions,\" said Kathrin Buvac, president of Nokia Enterprise and chief strategy officer, in a statement. \"Together, we will accelerate the digital transformation journey towards Industry 4.0, driving economic growth and productivity for both enterprises and service providers.\"\nMicrosoft also announced partnerships with Colt Technology Services and Cisco this week, among others.

Nokia was effectively the flagship Windows Phone vendor before its devices and services unit was bought by Microsoft in 2013.\nHowever the acquisition proved to be disastrous for Microsoft, which shifted away from mobile devices towards cloud services and software once Satya Nadella was appointed CEO.

Drew Angerer\u2014Getty Images By Aaron Pressman 8:55 AM EDT\nThis is the web version of Data Sheet, Fortune's daily newsletter on the top tech news. To get it delivered daily to your in box, sign up here.\nHappy Monday. Aaron here, back from vacation, essay writing and curating this week, as Adam goes off on a break.\nCatching up on all the tech news while I was away, I was sent spiraling down memory lane by Friday's GeekWire scoop that Microsoft maintains a list of \"prohibited and discouraged technology.\" Said list is said to ban popular work messaging app Slack (which we use at Fortune ) and online grammar checker Grammarly, while discouraging use of Google Docs, Amazon Web Services, and cloud security company PagerDuty. The various rationales offered in the document cite security concerns, but also the obvious rivalry aspects. For example: \"Slack Enterprise Grid version complies with Microsoft security requirements; however, we encourage use of Microsoft Teams rather than a competitive software.\" Microsoft declined to comment to GeekWire.\nThere's a long history of tech companies eschewing the products of their competitors. Google stopped its employees from using Microsoft Windows a decade ago, also citing security issues, and Microsoft discouraged use of the Apple iPhone early in the smartphone era.\nPersonally, I was sent back to my tenure at Yahoo, when CEO Marissa Mayer only allowed use of the company's ad laden, performance challenged web client for all work email. The proffered explanation was that the limitation would prompt employees to offer feedback\u2013and likely push for rapid improvements\u2013to help the engineers on the web email team better the product. That happened some, but it also sapped the productivity of people in jobs that depended on robust email communications capabilities, like, say, salespeople\u2013or reporters.\nThe new banned list at Microsoft is a bit surprising given that part of CEO Satya Nadella's successful strategy for reviving the software giant has been to embrace other platforms and abandon the only made here mindset. At the very least, deeply knowing the competition would help ensure Microsoft's own products keep pace. Historically, that may have been part of the problem behind what Bill Gates just called \"one of the greatest mistakes of all time.\" Appearing at an event at VC firm Village Global last week, Gates admitted he made that all time whopper by failing to create the mobile operating system alternative to Apple's iOS. Instead, Google, where co founder Sergey Brin was an early fan and avid user of the iPhone , grabbed the other spot. Gates called it a $400 billion mistake.\nHopefully, history won't repeat, despite the bans.\nAaron Pressman @ampressman aaron.pressman@fortune.com NEWSWORTHY\nThis time is different. It's been a banner beginning of summer for bitcoin investors, as the cryptocurrency on Monday traded above $11,000 for the first time in more than a year. Still a ways to go before bitcoin surmounts its previous high around $20,000 reached at the end of 2017, however.\nVirtually tit for tat. President Trump may have pulled back from standard military attacks on Iran last week, but he allowed a cyberattack on the country's rocket and missile launch computer systems to go forward, The Washington Post reports. Then on Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security warned U.S. businesses to beware of Iranian computer strikes. \"These are the guys that come in and they burn the house down,\" Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at DHS, said. The administration is also considering a further crackdown on the Chinese tech sector by requiring that all equipment used in U.S. 5G mobile networks be designed and manufactured outside of China. Even European telecom gear makers Nokia and Ericsson manufacture their products in China.\nFollow the money. Elsewhere in the nation's capitol, two senators plan to introduce legislation on Monday that would force tech companies like Google and Facebook to disclose the value of the user data they collect. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley announced their bill on Sunday night, dubbed the Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight And Regulations on Data, or DASHBOARD, Act on Sunday night.\nKeeping me up at night. A few new entries in the files of things to be concerned about. A New York Times story questions why Amazon allows counterfeit book listings. And The Los Angeles Times debates the collection of video by Amazon and Walmart's in home home delivery services.\nSize doesn't matter. Also a couple of news bits on the Raspberry Pi beat. NASA says the hackers who last year stole data about upcoming Mars missions cracked network security by breaching an unauthorized Pi computer connected to its network at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. On Monday, the nonprofit Raspberry Pi Foundation unveiled its fourth generation model of the credit card sized computer. Starting at $35, the Raspberry Pi 4 gets faster insides, more memory, and more ports.\nStart saving your pennies. We've got a new leak about Apple's rumored 16 inch laptop. The larger version of the MacBook Pro will have the highest screen resolution ever on an Apple laptop at 3072 pixels by 1920 pixels and will cost over $3,000.\nAdvertisement FOOD FOR THOUGHT\nSometimes it feels like Silicon Valley is leading a charge against the value of experienced employees, but that's not the case with venture capitalist Jeff Jordan of Andreessen Horowitz. In a profile of the seasoned, 60 year old investor, Fortune's own Polina Marinova examines Jordan's approach that led to winning early investments in Airbnb, Pinterest, and Instacart, among others. His prior work experience at stops including Disney and eBay were key to recognizing the winners, she writes. For example:\nJordan's first reaction to Airbnb was that it was \"the stupidest idea I had ever heard.\" It was 2011, and he was at an Allen & Co. tech investing meeting in Arizona. Brian Chesky, then a relatively unknown entrepreneur, was explaining his business, and Jordan couldn't help mentally listing the number of risks associated with opening up one's home to strangers. Then it hit him. Airbnb's fast growth and online marketplace that matched homeowners with renters reminded him of eBay. It was, he says, \"a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu experience.\" Having worked in top positions at eBay for seven years, he literally had seen this picture before.\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT\nElectric Planes, Flying Taxis, Supersonic Jets: Paris Air Show Gives Us a Peek at the Future of Flight By Phil Boucher\nWe Didn't Understand the Risks': Neil Armstrong's Sons Remember Life Under an Apollo 11 Astronaut's Roof By Alyssa Newcomb\nExclusive: Wells Fargo Favored Mortgage Master Blend Raises $130 Million By Robert Hackett\n7,000 Dogs Are Registered to Come to 'Work' at Amazon's Headquarters By Chris Morris\nWhy Barnes & Noble May Soon Look Like the Local Bookstores It Killed Off By Phil Wahba\nSorry Google\u2014Funding More Homes Won't Solve the Bay Area Housing Crunch By Stephane Kasriel\nWhy Focusing on Diversity Numbers Won't Really Make Companies More Inclusive By Tim Ryan\nAdvertisement BEFORE YOU GO\nI will not end my first newsletter back from vacation with tales of the delicious meals, amazing sites, and beautiful art I saw in Italy.

Everywhere you look, states, political actors, and troll farms are exploiting Internet tools to spread disinformation, propaganda, and, ultimately, influence. As Sophia Ignatidou, a Catham House fellow, writes for The Guardian , baddies are ramping up their abuse of data mining to hijack minds and behaviors. \"We may soon be dealing not just with disinformation or communications blackouts, but with mass scale surreptitious manipulation through nudging,\" she warns.\nCommunication has been weaponised, used to provoke, mislead and influence the public in numerous insidious ways. Disinformation was just the first stage of an evolving trend of using information to subvert democracy, confuse rival states, define the narrative and control public opinion. Using the large, unregulated, open environments that tech companies once promised would \"empower\" ordinary people, disinformation has spread rapidly across the globe. The power that tech companies offered us has become a priceless tool in propagandists' hands, who were right in thinking that a confused, rapidly globalising world is more vulnerable to the malleable beast of disinformation than straightforward propaganda. Whatever we do, however many fact checking initiatives we undertake, disinformation shows no sign of abating. It just mutates.\nFORTUNE RECON Millions View Fake Instagram Privacy Policy Shared by Rick Perry, Megan Rapinoe, Usher, and Julia Roberts By Alyssa Newcomb\nChina's Lax Attitude About Privacy Is Shifting by Clay Chandler\nFacebook Releases New Privacy Measures, But They May Not Appease Critics by Chris Morris\nTired of Robocalls?

The company also launched service out to better service differently abled customers.\nAt the Microsoft Build 2019 conference, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently demonstrated how Starbucks delivers its signature customer experience with new technologies.\nTo reduce disruptions to the experience and securely connect its devices in the cloud, Starbucks is partnering with Microsoft to deploy Azure Sphere, designed to secure the coming wave of connected internet of things (IoT) devices across its store equipment.\nThe IoT enabled machines collect more than a dozen data points for every shot of espresso pulled, from the type of beans used to the coffee's temperature and water quality, generating more than 5 megabytes of data in an eight hour shift. Microsoft worked with Starbucks to develop an external device called a guardian module to connect the company's various pieces of equipment to Azure Sphere in order to securely aggregate data and proactively identify problems with the machines.\nThe solution will also enable Starbucks to send new coffee recipes from the cloud directly to Azure Sphere enabled machines, which it has previously done by manually delivering the recipes to stores via thumb drive multiple times a year.\n\"Think about the complexity \u2014 we have to get to 30,000 stores in nearly 80 markets to update those recipes,\" said Jeff Wile, senior vice president of retail and core technology services for Starbucks Technology. \"That recipe push is a huge part of the cost savings and the justification for doing this.\"\nHe added that the goal with Azure Sphere is to shift from reactive maintenance to a predictive approach that heads off issues before they happen. In the long run, the company will leverage Azure Sphere for additional uses such as managing inventory and ordering supplies and will encourage suppliers of its devices to build the solution into future versions of their products.\nThe company is also developing a feature by Microsoft's Azure Blockchain Service for its mobile app that shows customers information about where their packaged coffee comes from, where it was specifically grown, what Starbucks is doing to support farmers in those locations, where and when it was roasted, tasting notes, and more.\nThis can not only empower farmers with more information and visibility once the beans leave their farms, but also allows customers to see the impact their coffee purchase has on the real people they're supporting.\n\"While high quality, handcrafted beverages are so important, it's the stories, the people, the connections, the humanity behind that coffee that inspires everything we do,\" says Michelle Burns, Starbucks senior vice president of Global Coffee & Tea. \"This kind of transparency offers customers the chance to see that the coffee they enjoy from us is the result of many people caring deeply.\"\nStarbucks previewed digital traceability for shareholders at its annual meeting in March. Eventually, customers will be able to use the Starbucks mobile app to trace the journey of their Starbucks packaged coffee.\nStarbucks has been using reinforcement learning technology \u2014 a type of machine learning in which a system learns to make decisions in complex, unpredictable environments based upon external feedback \u2014 to provide a more personalised experience for customers who use the Starbucks mobile app. Customers are more likely to get suggestions for items they will enjoy.\nWithin the app, customers receive tailor made order suggestions generated via a reinforcement learning platform that is built and hosted in Microsoft Azure. Through this technology and the work of Starbucks data scientists, 16 million active Starbucks Rewards members now receive recommendations from the app for food and drinks based on local store inventory, popular selections, weather, time of day, community preferences and previous orders.\n\"Just like their relationship with a barista, customers receive the same care and personalised recommendations when it comes from our digital platforms,\" said Jon Francis, senior vice president, Starbucks analytics and market research.\n\"Starbucks is an experience. Everything we do in technology is centred around the customer connection in the store, the human connection, one person, one cup, one neighbourhood at a time,\" said Gerri Martin Flickinger, Starbucks executive vice president and chief technology officer.\nStarbucks is looking to expand this technology to the drive thru experience.\nMartin Flickinger said, \"Using data for personalisation is vital to our mobile app, and now we are leveraging data to improve our drive thru experience.\"\nBecause the technology does not have the individual order histories for drive thru customers that are available for mobile app customers, it will generate relevant drive thru recommendations based on store transaction histories and more than 400 other store level criteria.\nStarbucks is currently testing this technology in its Tryer Center innovation hub in Seattle, with plans to roll it out soon. And according to Francis, reinforcement learning will continue to have an important role at Starbucks in many other applications going forward.\n\"We're meeting our customers where they are \u2014 whether in store, in their car or on the go through the app \u2014 using machine learning and artificial intelligence to understand and anticipate their personal preferences,\" Martin Flickinger said. \"Machine learning also plays a role in how we think about store design, engage with our partners, optimise inventory and create barista schedules. This capability will eventually touch all facets of how we run our business.\"\nIn addition to technology enhancement, Starbucks has opened its first Signing Store in Guangzhou, China, in a bid to offer more diverse and inclusive employment and career opportunities for the Deaf and hard of hearing community.\nThe store will serve as a welcoming hub for those passionate about improving accessibility and experiences for all and is located near the recognised Guangdong Disabled Association and Guangdong Deaf People Association.\n\"As a coffee leader deeply rooted in China, for China, Starbucks is committed to creating equal opportunities for everyone, as well as a unique third place experience that addresses a wide range of community needs. The new Signing Store is an example of how we are building inclusive environments and careers for our partners,\" said Belinda Wong, chief executive officer of Starbucks China.\nStarbucks currently employs over 100 employees with disabilities in China. Building on its efforts to nurture talent and create more opportunities for the Deaf workforce, Starbucks has partnered with the Guangdong Deaf People Association to offer professional skills training, including sign language courses and internship opportunities.\nSign language symbols are printed on umbrellas in front of the store, and there are indicators throughout the store. Deaf baristas will wear aprons with the word \"Starbucks\" embroidered in sign language.\nThe store is equipped with a customised ordering system. Customers and staff will be able to communicate using notepads and two way digital displays. For customers new to sign language, there will be a dedicated area for customers to write down their orders on an electronic board and wireless vibrating pagers will notify customers when their orders are ready.\nTo create an inclusive environment and encourage customers to learn more about the deaf community, the store will also offer sign language lessons and coffee workshops in sign language.", "URL": "https://www.marketing-interactive.com/starbucks-and-microsoft-partner-to-give-venue-tech-a-boost/"}, {"Title": "Sony&apos;s Deal With Microsoft Blindsided Its Own PlayStation Team", "Text": "Sony's Deal With Microsoft Blindsided Its Own PlayStation Team Sony's Deal With Microsoft Blindsided Its Own PlayStation Team #yahoo Perhaps no one was more shocked than employees of Sony's PlayStation division, who have spent almost two decades fighting the U.S. software giant in the $38 billion video game console market.

An Electrolux Pure i9 cleans a rug and flooring while navigating a table and sofa. (Photo courtesy of Electrolux)\nSimilarly, as more businesses connect their machines and equipment to the cloud, they are creating new data sources that drive astute, real time decisions. And IoT is helping many of those same companies evolve as they add solutions built with artificial intelligence, edge computing and, soon, 5G, George says.\n\"IoT is having a profound impact on things that I think of as invisible IoT \u2013 things like elevators becoming more reliable, water pumps that never break down, agriculture that uses 30 to 50 percent less energy and water,\" George says.\n\"Manufacturing also is becoming orders of magnitude more efficient and profitable while using less energy in the process, again due to IoT. There are just thousands of examples \u2013 all invisible to consumers day to day \u2013 that are having GDP impacting results across the world,\" he says.\nThe survey also showed: Companies that deployed an IoT solution have had, on average, a 25% return on investment \u2013 and those respondents expect their ROI to grow to 30% in two years. Among IoT adopters, 38% cite complexity and technical challenges to using IoT as a barrier to further their IoT adoption. Lack of available IT talent and training present challenges for half of IoT adopters, with 47% responding that there are not enough available skilled tech workers.\nThe potential for IoT to reshape industries is significant, says George, who is seeing evidence of this change across retail, energy, agriculture, manufacturing and more. Below are some examples George cited of businesses taking advantage of catalytic innovations in IoT.\nthyssenkrupp\nthyssenkrupp built its \"Innovation Test Tower\" in Rottweil, Germany. More than 800 feet tall, the laboratory is where the company can try new technologies and showcase them to potential customers and to the public. It's both a test lab and an active commercial building, with nearly 200,000 square feet of occupied office space and IoT sensors that transmit data of all kinds 24 hours a day.\nAt its test tower in 2017, thyssenkrupp Elevator unveiled MULTI , a groundbreaking, rope less and sideways moving elevator. YouTube Video\n\"We wanted to find new ways to use IoT sensor technology to make a building interact with the facility manager and the owner,\" says Michael Cesarz, chief executive officer for MULTI at thyssenkrupp Elevator. \"thyssenkrupp is uniquely positioned to do that, because an elevator is the nervous system of a building, and the shafts are like the backbone \u2013 they are a crucial structural element and they touch every single floor and serve every single tenant.\"\nTo help develop new solutions in the Innovation Test Tower, thyssenkrupp partnered with Willow , a member of the Microsoft Partner Network. thyssenkrupp uses the company's Willow Twin platform powered by Azure IoT which provides a \"digital twin\" of the tower that delivers actionable insights to the building managers.\nStarbucks\nEach Starbucks store has more than a dozen pieces of equipment, from coffee machines to grinders and blenders, that must be operational around 16 hours a day. A glitch in any of those devices can mean service calls that rack up repair costs. More significantly, equipment problems can potentially interfere with Starbucks' primary goal of providing a consistently high quality customer experience.\n\"Any time we can create additional moments of connection between our partners and customers, we want to explore and activate,\" says Natarajan \"Venkat\" Venkatakrishnan, vice president of global equipment for Starbucks. \"Our machines are what allow our partners to create that special beverage, and ensuring they are working properly is critical.\"\nTo reduce disruptions to that experience and securely connect its devices in the cloud, Starbucks is partnering with Microsoft to deploy Azure Sphere , designed to secure the coming wave of connected IoT devices across its store equipment.\nStarbucks is delivering personalized recommendations to customers via its mobile app and, soon, its drive thrus.

Aflatoxin often can't be seen, smelled or tasted, and it's not destroyed by heat \u2013 so cooking contaminated food doesn't make it safe.\nIngestion of high levels of aflatoxin can be fatal, and chronic exposure can result in serious health problems, according to the International Food Policy Research Institute. There are about 155,000 new cases a year of cancer caused by aflatoxin \u2013 it's the leading cause of liver cancer in developing countries.\nB\u00fchler engineers are fighting aflatoxin in corn by combining new camera and UV lighting technology, shown here being assembled. (Photo courtesy of B\u00fchler)\nSince consumers can't tell if their food is infected, the onus is entirely on growers, harvesters and processors \u2013 more of whom are having to fight the mold as it expands north amid climate change that stresses crops and makes them more susceptible. So the stakes are high for the new corn processing system B\u00fchler engineers developed as part of an innovation challenge.\nWith the LumoVision optical sorter, corn gets fed from a truck into a hopper above the 6 foot tall machine, and a vibratory feeder sends it into a chute where it accelerates to 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) a second as it flows in a single layer. UV lights illuminate the corn. A camera on each side of the chute monitors the lighted grains, looking for the telltale fluorescence of aflatoxin infection.\nHigh speed valves operating compressed air jets \u2013 which can open or close in a thousandth of a second \u2013 simply shoot any contaminated kernels into the rejects bin, letting the rest of the healthy corn pass through into storage or shipping containers.\nWeather patterns at the time of harvest, the health of other lots harvested in the area and other relevant data points can be uploaded to the B\u00fchler Insights platform hosted on the Microsoft cloud to augment the machine data. This can then be combined with information from the cameras as they watch the grains pass by, monitored and analyzed using IoT and edge computing to provide a real time risk assessment on the crop and guide the system's processes. If the risk is minimal, sorting can be paused while monitoring continues. If the risk rises, sorting automatically restarts.\n\"This came at exactly the right time for us, because we were just starting our digital journey toward data analytics and the Internet of Things,\" says Stuart Bashford, B\u00fchler's digital officer. \"The general concept for something like this had been around for years, but the technology never existed before to make it commercially viable. But now it's all come together in this incredibly rewarding project.\"\nChevron\nDeep within a Chevron fuel refinery, one key machine is now talking \u2013 and revealing secrets about its own health.\nThat chatty piece of equipment, called a heat exchanger, removes the heat from fluids flowing through it as part of the plant's fuel processing.\nA heat exchanger affixed with cloud connected sensors. (Photo courtesy of Chevron)\nIn a pilot program, Chevron affixed some exchangers with wireless, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors that collect and send real time data from the heat exchanger to the cloud \u2013 supplementing information already gathered by the safety and control system.\nData scientists then analyze that fresh data to check the equipment's health status now, and to predict its condition in the future.\n\"Understanding the health of these exchangers can prevent unscheduled outages as well as optimize when we clean these units,\" says Deon Rae, a Chevron fellow and lead of Chevron's IIoT Center of Excellence. \"That has the potential to save the company millions of dollars a year when scaled across our whole inventory of heat exchangers.\"\nThe company plans to expand that same IoT technology to other pieces of equipment at facilities around the world to similarly monitor their health and forecast their performance, Rae says. Chevron has more than 5,000 heat exchangers in active operations in more than 100 countries. Deploying health monitoring across different pieces of equipment has the potential to provide significant savings.\nToyota Material Handing Group\nToyota Material Handling Group is the largest forklift manufacturer in the world, but its customers require much more than warehouse trucks and equipment.

(Photo courtesy of Toyota Material Handling Group)\nWith Microsoft technologies, the solutions range from connected forklift and field service systems available today to AI powered concepts that pave the way for intelligent automation and logistics simulation \u2013 all designed with Toyota's standards for optimizing efficiency, operation assistance and kaizen , or continuous improvement.\n\"Our direction is going to more systemizing and logistics solutions, services in digital automation, AI analytics and IoT,\" says Toshihide Itoh, associate director and CIO of Toyota Material Handling Group, an Aichi, Japan based division of Toyota Industries Corporation. \"We also continue to improve our forklift trucks, because this is our origin. But customers need more and more efficient logistics and we need digital innovation to accelerate and expand our business.\"\nToyota has presented its vision for a future warehouse with lean logistics and pre trained, intelligent forklifts. Enabled with machine learning and IoT services in Microsoft Azure, the vehicles can quickly learn navigation in a virtual model of a customer's warehouse, a so called \"digital twin.\" Customers can experience the trucks interacting with their physical and virtual environment.\nThe ability to simulate and visualize a physical environment will help solve one of the biggest challenges in the industry: the long deployment time for customized IoT solutions. Installations can normally take six months to a year, but using machine learning and digital twins can significantly shorten the time.\nElectrolux\nNumerous studies have shown that bad air outside affects air quality inside homes and offices, entering through ventilation systems.\nEven worse, pollutants generated inside from cleaning supplies, cooking and fireplaces can be even harder on your health than what you breathe out on the street, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\nAn app for the Electrolux Pure A9 offers real time data, including the state of indoor air quality. (Photo courtesy of Electrolux)\nThe Pure A9 \u2013 an IoT connected air purifier built with Microsoft Azure \u2013 removes ultra fine dust particles, pollutants, bacteria, allergens and bad odors from indoor rooms. It launched March 1 in four Nordic countries plus Switzerland and, previously, in Korea.\nBy linking the purifier and its associated app to the cloud, Electrolux can show the product's users real time data about their air quality \u2013 inside and outside \u2013 while tracking interior air improvement over time. In addition, the Pure A9 continuously monitors its filter usage, alerting users when it's time to order a replacement filter.\nAnd as a connected appliance, the Pure A9 eventually may have the ability to learn the daily patterns of when household occupants are typically away, enabling the device to run itself on a smart schedule, Larsson says.\n\"If we can predict when the house is empty, we make sure not to waste filter by cleaning air that nobody is going to breathe,\" says Andreas Larsson, engineering director at Electrolux. \"Then we can start the purification, so the air is clean when you come home.\"\nVisit the Official Microsoft Blog to read more from the survey's breakdown of IoT trends.\nTop photo: Starbucks partners are able to spend more time hand crafting the perfect beverage and less time on machine maintenance thanks to cloud connected devices.

The company also launched service out to better service differently abled customers.\nAt the Microsoft Build 2019 conference, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently demonstrated how Starbucks delivers its signature customer experience with new technologies.\nTo reduce disruptions to the experience and securely connect its devices in the cloud, Starbucks is partnering with Microsoft to deploy Azure Sphere, designed to secure the coming wave of connected internet of things (IoT) devices across its store equipment.\nThe IoT enabled machines collect more than a dozen data points for every shot of espresso pulled, from the type of beans used to the coffee's temperature and water quality, generating more than 5 megabytes of data in an eight hour shift. Microsoft worked with Starbucks to develop an external device called a guardian module to connect the company's various pieces of equipment to Azure Sphere in order to securely aggregate data and proactively identify problems with the machines.\nThe solution will also enable Starbucks to send new coffee recipes from the cloud directly to Azure Sphere enabled machines, which it has previously done by manually delivering the recipes to stores via thumb drive multiple times a year.\n\"Think about the complexity \u2014 we have to get to 30,000 stores in nearly 80 markets to update those recipes,\" said Jeff Wile, senior vice president of retail and core technology services for Starbucks Technology. \"That recipe push is a huge part of the cost savings and the justification for doing this.\"\nHe added that the goal with Azure Sphere is to shift from reactive maintenance to a predictive approach that heads off issues before they happen. In the long run, the company will leverage Azure Sphere for additional uses such as managing inventory and ordering supplies and will encourage suppliers of its devices to build the solution into future versions of their products.\nThe company is also developing a feature by Microsoft's Azure Blockchain Service for its mobile app that shows customers information about where their packaged coffee comes from, where it was specifically grown, what Starbucks is doing to support farmers in those locations, where and when it was roasted, tasting notes, and more.\nThis can not only empower farmers with more information and visibility once the beans leave their farms, but also allows customers to see the impact their coffee purchase has on the real people they're supporting.\n\"While high quality, handcrafted beverages are so important, it's the stories, the people, the connections, the humanity behind that coffee that inspires everything we do,\" says Michelle Burns, Starbucks senior vice president of Global Coffee & Tea. \"This kind of transparency offers customers the chance to see that the coffee they enjoy from us is the result of many people caring deeply.\"\nStarbucks previewed digital traceability for shareholders at its annual meeting in March. Eventually, customers will be able to use the Starbucks mobile app to trace the journey of their Starbucks packaged coffee.\nStarbucks has been using reinforcement learning technology \u2014 a type of machine learning in which a system learns to make decisions in complex, unpredictable environments based upon external feedback \u2014 to provide a more personalised experience for customers who use the Starbucks mobile app. Customers are more likely to get suggestions for items they will enjoy.\nWithin the app, customers receive tailor made order suggestions generated via a reinforcement learning platform that is built and hosted in Microsoft Azure. Through this technology and the work of Starbucks data scientists, 16 million active Starbucks Rewards members now receive recommendations from the app for food and drinks based on local store inventory, popular selections, weather, time of day, community preferences and previous orders.\n\"Just like their relationship with a barista, customers receive the same care and personalised recommendations when it comes from our digital platforms,\" said Jon Francis, senior vice president, Starbucks analytics and market research.\n\"Starbucks is an experience. Everything we do in technology is centred around the customer connection in the store, the human connection, one person, one cup, one neighbourhood at a time,\" said Gerri Martin Flickinger, Starbucks executive vice president and chief technology officer.\nStarbucks is looking to expand this technology to the drive thru experience.\nMartin Flickinger said, \"Using data for personalisation is vital to our mobile app, and now we are leveraging data to improve our drive thru experience.\"\nBecause the technology does not have the individual order histories for drive thru customers that are available for mobile app customers, it will generate relevant drive thru recommendations based on store transaction histories and more than 400 other store level criteria.\nStarbucks is currently testing this technology in its Tryer Center innovation hub in Seattle, with plans to roll it out soon. And according to Francis, reinforcement learning will continue to have an important role at Starbucks in many other applications going forward.\n\"We're meeting our customers where they are \u2014 whether in store, in their car or on the go through the app \u2014 using machine learning and artificial intelligence to understand and anticipate their personal preferences,\" Martin Flickinger said. \"Machine learning also plays a role in how we think about store design, engage with our partners, optimise inventory and create barista schedules. This capability will eventually touch all facets of how we run our business.\"\nIn addition to technology enhancement, Starbucks has opened its first Signing Store in Guangzhou, China, in a bid to offer more diverse and inclusive employment and career opportunities for the Deaf and hard of hearing community.\nThe store will serve as a welcoming hub for those passionate about improving accessibility and experiences for all and is located near the recognised Guangdong Disabled Association and Guangdong Deaf People Association.\n\"As a coffee leader deeply rooted in China, for China, Starbucks is committed to creating equal opportunities for everyone, as well as a unique third place experience that addresses a wide range of community needs. The new Signing Store is an example of how we are building inclusive environments and careers for our partners,\" said Belinda Wong, chief executive officer of Starbucks China.\nStarbucks currently employs over 100 employees with disabilities in China. Building on its efforts to nurture talent and create more opportunities for the Deaf workforce, Starbucks has partnered with the Guangdong Deaf People Association to offer professional skills training, including sign language courses and internship opportunities.\nSign language symbols are printed on umbrellas in front of the store, and there are indicators throughout the store. Deaf baristas will wear aprons with the word \"Starbucks\" embroidered in sign language.\nThe store is equipped with a customised ordering system. Customers and staff will be able to communicate using notepads and two way digital displays. For customers new to sign language, there will be a dedicated area for customers to write down their orders on an electronic board and wireless vibrating pagers will notify customers when their orders are ready.\nTo create an inclusive environment and encourage customers to learn more about the deaf community, the store will also offer sign language lessons and coffee workshops in sign language.", "URL": "https://www.marketing-interactive.com/starbucks-and-microsoft-partner-to-give-venue-tech-a-boost/"}, {"Title": "Sony&apos;s Deal With Microsoft Blindsided Its Own PlayStation Team", "Text": "Sony's Deal With Microsoft Blindsided Its Own PlayStation Team Sony's Deal With Microsoft Blindsided Its Own PlayStation Team #yahoo Perhaps no one was more shocked than employees of Sony's PlayStation division, who have spent almost two decades fighting the U.S. software giant in the $38 billion video game console market.

He sounded exasperated.\n\"Everyone has been deaf, dumb, and blind moving to the cloud. They think it's safe, convenient, easy\u2014that they've moved to the happy place,\" Eades told me. The point he stressed: Even after a company taps into the cloud\u2014that buzzy nickname for the remotely managed computing resources offered by the likes of Amazon , Microsoft , Google , and others\u2014it retains responsibilities. IT professionals cannot wipe their hands of infrastructure upkeep concerns completely.\nFollowing that call, I wrote a piece for the latest issue of Fortune , published online this morning, which asks, \" After the Capital One Breach, Should Big Business Fear the Public Cloud? \" Generally, as just about every cybersecurity expert I spoke to underscored, the answer is, No.\nThe advantages of the cloud are simply too compelling. Businesses can tap the on demand storage and computing resources they need when they need, thereby reducing waste. Dedicated, crack teams take care of most patching and software updates. The cloud is undeniably convenient and, more importantly, better in terms of security than what the majority of companies can achieve alone.\nDon't take it from me\u2014take it from a practitioner. \"People have been suggesting that there's something inherently bad about cloud infrastructure and I, frankly, think it's just the opposite,\" Edward Amoroso, the former chief security officer of AT&T , told me. (The telecom giant, it must be noted, knows a thing or two about managing complex IT systems.)\nEven Capital One attributes its ability to recover quickly from its breach to its embracement of the cloud. As Sie Soheili, a Capital One spokesperson, emphasized in bolded text in an email to me: \" The speed with which we were able to diagnose and fix this vulnerability, and determine its effect, was enabled by our cloud operating model.\"\nI wondered, upon reading that statement, whether Capital One had no other choice but to double down on a cloud endorsement, given how far down the rabbit hole it has ventured since it began its IT migration five years ago. (On an earnings call earlier this year, CEO Richard Fairbank said he planned to eliminate the last of the bank's data centers in favor of the cloud by 2020.) But even that default posture of journalistic skepticism cannot counter the truth: Moving some portion of one's operations to the cloud is no cybersecurity panacea, but it is, in most cases, an obvious boon.\nRobert Hackett | @rhhackett | robert.hackett@fortune.com\nTHREATS Privacy gaslighting.

Everywhere you look, states, political actors, and troll farms are exploiting Internet tools to spread disinformation, propaganda, and, ultimately, influence. As Sophia Ignatidou, a Catham House fellow, writes for The Guardian , baddies are ramping up their abuse of data mining to hijack minds and behaviors. \"We may soon be dealing not just with disinformation or communications blackouts, but with mass scale surreptitious manipulation through nudging,\" she warns.\nCommunication has been weaponised, used to provoke, mislead and influence the public in numerous insidious ways. Disinformation was just the first stage of an evolving trend of using information to subvert democracy, confuse rival states, define the narrative and control public opinion. Using the large, unregulated, open environments that tech companies once promised would \"empower\" ordinary people, disinformation has spread rapidly across the globe. The power that tech companies offered us has become a priceless tool in propagandists' hands, who were right in thinking that a confused, rapidly globalising world is more vulnerable to the malleable beast of disinformation than straightforward propaganda. Whatever we do, however many fact checking initiatives we undertake, disinformation shows no sign of abating.

Bellevue, Washington based Icertis is a leading player in the market that recently achieved a Unicorn status for its AI based platform.\nIcertis' Offerings\nIcertis was set up in 2009 by Monish Dorda and Samir Bodas in Pune, India. They wanted to transform the contract management process. Its AI based Icertis Contract Management (ICM) platform helps organizations across multiple sectors manage their contracts. It enables users to handle contracts ranging from procurement and sales to non disclosure agreements. Additionally, it helps users create contracts, tracks when terms are met, ensures regulatory compliance, and automates administrative tasks like sending renewal reminders.\nIcertis's Platform runs on the cloud. It was built on Microsoft Azure but also integrates with other public clouds like Salesforce.com and the Google Cloud Platform. It has managed to attract quite a bevy of clients including names like Microsoft, HBO, Skullcandy, Cognizant, Lending Club, and Airtel.\nIcertis prides itself on having built a platform that is easy to use, customize, and adopt. Its AI capabilities have helped build a platform that offers compliance and track risks each time the contract is modified, or there are external data changes. It allows organizations to better track potential liabilities and discover hidden value by automatically searching metadata for related contracts and provide a holistic view of any given contract's complex dependencies. It is an enterprise wide platform that offers a centralized repository across all departments to provide 360 degree visibility across every contract for every user, along with giving them a holistic view of dependencies, risks, and all related data.\nIcertis' Financials\nIcertis is privately held and does not disclose its detailed financials. According to recent reports, it is managing 5.7 million contracts, valued at more than $1 trillion. Analysts estimate its revenues at close to $100 million.\nIt has raised $211 million in funding so far from investors including Greycroft, Cross Creek, PremjiInvest, B Capital Group, Ignition Partners, PSP Growth, Eight Roads Ventures, e.ventures, and Meritech Capital Partners. Its last round of funding was held in July this year when it raised $115 million in a round led by Greycroft and PremjiInvest.

Once a staple of science fiction lore, it's now become part of modern daily lives. One example is office automation which began back in the day with basic document management. It wasn't long ago that everyone used typewriters and filing cabinets to manage their office documents, until PCs emerged in the 1980s. Microsoft Word eventually became the norm, followed by landmark products Microsoft Office in 1990, Office 2003, and eventually more sophisticated present day technology like Dynamics 365. The Case for Document Generation\nThere's no question that a CRM can help your company with sales, marketing, customer service, and more but what about document generation? This is where <> Xpertdoc comes into play. When integrated with CRM, <> Xpertdoc fully automates the processes for the generation, management, storage and delivery of business documents. Not only can you design document templates but business users can <> visually model and deploy document workflows leveraging data from any available source (like Dynamics 365), addressing the most complex document scenarios while eliminating the need for technical knowledge or coding skills. Generating documents in 4 easy steps\nThe very first step of the document generation process is connecting your data source like MS Dynamics 365 for example. Once that is done, you'll need to create a data set. Not to worry, it's not as technical as it sounds. A data set is just a collection of business data in a database. <> Xpertdoc Smart Flows for Dynamics 365 features an updated <> Data Set Builder with a modern user interface and easy navigation, i.e. no programming skills required.\nNow that you've got your data set, it's time to design your template using our <> Microsoft Word based Template Designer (check out a previous <> blog post on best practices for template design ) The ability to combine data sets from multiple sources into a single template allows you to tie up loose ends in one fell swoop. You decide to create customized templates for different regions, which your sales force can access via a dashboard. With your customized template, you can auto fill information for your repeat customers, which saves time and creates a more efficient customer experience (CX). Once your template's in place, you're all set to run a <> document flow.\nThere are more wide reaching benefits of a document generation system, such as content search capabilities, e signature support and more. You can archive templates, creating a personal library of enterprise information. The Single Sign on authentication feature of <> Xpertdoc Sm <> art Flows eliminates the need to remember passwords, providing a fast and easy connection. And speaking of connecting, you can enjoy flexible deployment options, either onsite or in a public or private cloud.\nA modern document generation tool like <> Xpertdoc provides more automated capabilities and a competitive business advantage than old fashioned document management.\n<>", "URL": "http://www.businessintelligenceinfo.com/crm/microsoft-dynamics-crm/adding-value-to-microsoft-dynamics-365-with-document-generation"}]}, {"client": "WALMART | GB000QCY", "industry": "Retail", "segment": "Industry", "intensity": 608.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft Azure IoT Hub, Microsoft System Center OpsMgr, Microsoft System Center, Microsoft Azure, Azure IoT", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Strong", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA | GB000QG0", "industry": "Education", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 20.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "GENERAL DYNAMICS | GB000QV1", "industry": "Aerospace & Defense", "segment": "Industry", "intensity": 39.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "SAP GMBH | GB000S12", "industry": "Computer Services", "segment": "Commercial", "intensity": 5.0, "market": "ASEAN", "products": "Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "SAP GMBH | GB000S12", "industry": "Computer Services", "segment": "Commercial", "intensity": 4.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "EMC CORPORATION | GB000S1M", "industry": "Wholesale Distribution & Services", "segment": "Commercial", "intensity": 192.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft Azure, Microsoft System Center", "score": 8.0, "relationshipStrength": "Neutral", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": [{"Title": "Best of the Week: New CenturyLink Contract, Top SD-WAN Providers, More", "Text": "11 hours ago Take a deep breath, everyone.\nWe read about layoffs in March.

The two technology giants announced a multi year alliance, focused on cloud, AI, 5G, and edge computing.\nThe AT&T Microsoft partnership has AT&T agreeing to migrate much of its non network infrastructure applications to the Microsoft Azure cloud. AT&T will also equip much of its workforce with the cloud based Microsoft 365 office and collaboration suite.\nThis looks to be a big win for the Microsoft cloud business line, and probably at the expense of Amazon AWS and Google cloud rivals.\nThe partnership will also have Microsoft tap AT&T technologies, including 5G, to build edge computing capabilities and applications. The two companies plan to work together to bring integrated technology applications to market, including voice, collaboration and conferencing, intelligent edge and networking, IoT, public safety, and cybersecurity, a press release states.\n\"AT&T is at the forefront of defining how advances in technology, including 5G and edge computing, will transform every aspect of work and life,\" said Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft in a prepared statement. \"Together, we will apply the power of Azure and Microsoft 365 to transform the way AT&T's workforce collaborates and to shape the future of media and communications for people everywhere.\"\nAT&T Microsoft Partnership The two companies point to a collaborative effort on an edge computing based effort for tracking and detecting drones as an example of the type of applications that could emerge from this deal. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella with AT&T Communications CEO John Donovan (Source: AT&T)\nAnother potential example includes a scenario where a 5G equipped first responder uses AI powered live voice translation to communicate with someone in need who speaks a different language.\n\"AT&T and Microsoft are among the most committed companies to fostering technology that serves people,\" said John Donovan, CEO, AT&T Communications in a prepared statement. \"By working together on common efforts around 5G, the cloud, and AI, we will accelerate the speed of innovation and impact for our customers and our communities.\"\nThe AT&T Microsoft partnership appears to be broader than the just announced AT&T IBM deal. That deal is cloud focused as well but is limited to the AT&T Business Solutions business unit, helping to better manage internal applications. A key objective of the IBM deal is to provide tools for AT&T Business solutions to better serve enterprise customers. Did you like this post? Please consider sharing it:", "URL": "https://www.telecompetitor.com/att-taps-microsoft-for-broad-strategic-cloud-partnership/"}, {"Title": "AT&T, Microsoft sharpen their edge with mega-partnership", "Text": "Lower latency 5G is the pot of gold at the end of this particular rainbow It's not just about making up for AT&T's lack of in house cloud infrastructure and skills Both parties will benefit from that all important on ramp into each other's environments\nAT&T and Microsoft's mega deal announcement covers an awful lot of ground, on the face of it, but what it really boils down to is the edge.\nIt's the mutual on ramp relationship that promises to deliver the most value to both sides of this partnership. AT&T gets a direct connection to a public cloud giant that can deploy and host services closer to customers, thereby lowering latency. Similarly, Microsoft will shorten the distance between its data centres and end users; it won't have to deliver them to AT&T's network via the Internet. Customers are the ultimate beneficiaries, of course; this is all good news for stuff like AR/VR, and remote controlled machines like drones and cars.\nIn the longer term, AT&T could potentially be in a position to host Microsoft services on its own infrastructure, despite having already sold off its data centres. Philip Laidler, partner and consulting director at STL Partners, explained recently to TelecomTV that as telcos virtualise and distribute more network functions, they could be in a position to host services from the likes of Microsoft in the same facilities that host these virtualised networks. Sure, some telcos might host their entire virtualised networks in third party data centres, but most might prefer to maintain some of their own facilities.\n\"Operators are building small data centres to support their virtualised networks and therefore they essentially are going to have an environment that they can use to offer edge compute, whether it's the complete stack, or some of the stack, or if it's NFVi, or it's entirely separate physical infrastructure that just sits alongside it in a different cabinet,\" Laidler said.\nIn this context, the AT&T Microsoft deal isn't just about AT&T making up for its lack of in house cloud expertise or infrastructure (although more on that later). There are benefits here for Microsoft that could prove vital to its rivalry with Amazon and Google.\nThere are also mutual benefits here when it comes to navigating the sheer complexity of distributed cloud and edge computing. It's not just about 5G. There will be services deployed at the edge that will want to reach the end user over Wi Fi, NB IoT, LTE M, fibre, LoRaWAN and so on. Different services will make different demands on the network. Through collaboration, the industry stands a better chance of making it all work.\nOf course, you can't spend ages negotiating a big partnership just to sum it all up like that. No, you have to tick off buzzwords like AI, and hammer home the point about how great this is for 5G. It's all relevant, of course, but it somewhat clouds (geddit?) the more important issues. Extra tuition\nAn equally interesting strand to this partnership relates to tooling up and skilling up. It couldn't be more obvious from AT&T's announcement \u2013 and the partnership announced earlier this week with IBM \u2013 that the telco is following through with its major commitment to cloud.\nUnder its 'public cloud first' strategy, AT&T plans to shift most of its non network workloads to the public cloud by 2024. Its partnership with Microsoft will see AT&T equip staff with Microsoft 365, and migrate non network infrastructure applications to Azure.\nWhat has become obvious then, is that while once upon a time, AT&T's major commitment to cloud would have involved capex, and building or acquiring data centres, now it necessitates broad and deep partnerships with experts in the field, highlighting how telcos \u2013 even giants like AT&T \u2013 have missed their window for becoming the experts themselves.\nAs Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella put it: \"The world's leading companies run on our cloud, and we are delighted that AT&T chose Microsoft to accelerate its innovation. Together, we will apply the power of Azure and Microsoft 365 to transform the way AT&T's workforce collaborates and to shape the future of media and communications for people everywhere.\" Related Topics", "URL": "https://www.telecomtv.com/content/edge/at-t-microsoft-sharpen-their-edge-with-mega-partnership-35814/"}, {"Title": "Windows Server 2008 End of Life & Microsoft Helps Nunavut Recover: FoxNet IT Round Up", "Text": "Microsoft Steps in to Help Nunavut Deal with Ransomware Fallout The Nunavut government experienced a ransomware attack in early November which affected their public services department.

The company has partnered with Microsoft to create commercial Internet of Things (IoT) solutions in the areas of energy management and automation, thus bringing power and process systems together. Through this platform, Schneider Electric aims to address the challenges of market volatility in the O&G sector, while reducing capex and opex by 20 30%.\nWhen power and process management systems operate as separate silos, industrial organisations soon find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. Separate teams of engineers and programmers are needed to build up and maintain operations. As a result, the cost of supporting these complex, customised interfaces across the lifetime of the asset is high and it restricts the organisation's ability to respond to changing market conditions. With the introduction of EP&P in the Indian market, companies in the oil, gas & petrochemical sector can break down the traditional barriers between power and process control systems to solve critical engineering and operating challenges. This can result in better returns on capital employed (ROCE), with a 20% reduction in capex, 15% reduction in downtime, and 3% growth in profitability.\nAnil Chaudhry, zone president & MD, Schneider Electric India, said, \"Marketplace changes and technology advancements are making the once daunting task of converging power and process systems an attainable, cost justifiable goal. The Indian hydrocarbon sector is at the cusp of major transformation as companies across the value chain step up their efforts to boost India's self sufficiency in oil and gas, expand refining capacities, and set up pipeline infrastructure for transportation across the country. Through our partnership with Microsoft we aim to deliver real/tangible solutions and measurable business results for oil and gas players, improve efficiency, bring down cost of running operations and raise profitability.\"\nMeetul Patel, COO, Microsoft India, said, \"Operations in the oil & gas industry are highly dispersed, making the efficient management of assets extremely challenging. Microsoft's Azure platform provides Schneider Electric with advanced cloud and edge computing technologies to establish an intelligent network of IoT devices that can provide insights, drive innovative new solutions, and improve returns from investments.\"\nBy leveraging Schneider Electric EcoStruxure IoT enabled system architecture and platform, customers can connect assets that are the centre of their projects with assets that are at the center of their operations across the full lifecycle of their plants, including their supply chains. By offering both tangible IoT solutions that are available today as well as leading edge innovation to address future needs, customers will benefit from the blend of domain/subject matter expertise from Schneider Electric and industry leading cloud technology from Microsoft.\nSharing the compelling value proposition of Schneider Electric's EcoStruxure, Navtej Garewal, executive VP, head of India, Aveva, added, \"The addition of the app and analytics piece and the access to prior information with the creation of digital twin will help create new insights and empower customers to fuel digital transformation in the oil, gas and petrochemical industry in India.\"\nAbout Schneider Electric\nSchneider Electric is leading the Digital Transformation of Energy Management and Automation in Homes, Buildings, Data Centers, Infrastructure and Industries.

Well, unlike many news organisations, we have no sponsors, no corporate or ideological interests. We don't put up a paywall \u00e2 we beleive in free public access to information. Although underresourced & primarily volunteer based, we endeavour to provide the community with real time access to true unfiltered news directly from the firsthand sources. Our goal and mission is to provide free and alternative access to impartial information, fighting media monopolization and adhering to honesty, neutrality, fairness, transparency and independence in collection and dissemination of information. It is a bumpy road with all sorties of difficulties. (Media ownership in Australia is one of the most concentrated in the world ( more on this! ). Since the trend of consolidation is and has historically been upward, fewer and fewer individuals or organizations control increasing shares of the mass media in our country. According to independent assessment, about 98% of the media sector is held by three conglomerates. This tendency is not only totally unacceptable, but also to a degree frightening). Learn more We can only achieve this goal together. Our website is open to any citizen journalists and organizations who want to contribute, publish high quality insights or send media releases to improve public access to impartial information.

The two technology giants announced a multi year alliance, focused on cloud, AI, 5G, and edge computing.\nThe AT&T Microsoft partnership has AT&T agreeing to migrate much of its non network infrastructure applications to the Microsoft Azure cloud. AT&T will also equip much of its workforce with the cloud based Microsoft 365 office and collaboration suite.\nThis looks to be a big win for the Microsoft cloud business line, and probably at the expense of Amazon AWS and Google cloud rivals.\nThe partnership will also have Microsoft tap AT&T technologies, including 5G, to build edge computing capabilities and applications. The two companies plan to work together to bring integrated technology applications to market, including voice, collaboration and conferencing, intelligent edge and networking, IoT, public safety, and cybersecurity, a press release states.\n\"AT&T is at the forefront of defining how advances in technology, including 5G and edge computing, will transform every aspect of work and life,\" said Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft in a prepared statement. \"Together, we will apply the power of Azure and Microsoft 365 to transform the way AT&T's workforce collaborates and to shape the future of media and communications for people everywhere.\"\nAT&T Microsoft Partnership The two companies point to a collaborative effort on an edge computing based effort for tracking and detecting drones as an example of the type of applications that could emerge from this deal. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella with AT&T Communications CEO John Donovan (Source: AT&T)\nAnother potential example includes a scenario where a 5G equipped first responder uses AI powered live voice translation to communicate with someone in need who speaks a different language.\n\"AT&T and Microsoft are among the most committed companies to fostering technology that serves people,\" said John Donovan, CEO, AT&T Communications in a prepared statement. \"By working together on common efforts around 5G, the cloud, and AI, we will accelerate the speed of innovation and impact for our customers and our communities.\"\nThe AT&T Microsoft partnership appears to be broader than the just announced AT&T IBM deal. That deal is cloud focused as well but is limited to the AT&T Business Solutions business unit, helping to better manage internal applications. A key objective of the IBM deal is to provide tools for AT&T Business solutions to better serve enterprise customers. Did you like this post?

AT&T gets a direct connection to a public cloud giant that can deploy and host services closer to customers, thereby lowering latency. Similarly, Microsoft will shorten the distance between its data centres and end users; it won't have to deliver them to AT&T's network via the Internet. Customers are the ultimate beneficiaries, of course; this is all good news for stuff like AR/VR, and remote controlled machines like drones and cars.\nIn the longer term, AT&T could potentially be in a position to host Microsoft services on its own infrastructure, despite having already sold off its data centres. Philip Laidler, partner and consulting director at STL Partners, explained recently to TelecomTV that as telcos virtualise and distribute more network functions, they could be in a position to host services from the likes of Microsoft in the same facilities that host these virtualised networks. Sure, some telcos might host their entire virtualised networks in third party data centres, but most might prefer to maintain some of their own facilities.\n\"Operators are building small data centres to support their virtualised networks and therefore they essentially are going to have an environment that they can use to offer edge compute, whether it's the complete stack, or some of the stack, or if it's NFVi, or it's entirely separate physical infrastructure that just sits alongside it in a different cabinet,\" Laidler said.\nIn this context, the AT&T Microsoft deal isn't just about AT&T making up for its lack of in house cloud expertise or infrastructure (although more on that later). There are benefits here for Microsoft that could prove vital to its rivalry with Amazon and Google.\nThere are also mutual benefits here when it comes to navigating the sheer complexity of distributed cloud and edge computing. It's not just about 5G. There will be services deployed at the edge that will want to reach the end user over Wi Fi, NB IoT, LTE M, fibre, LoRaWAN and so on. Different services will make different demands on the network. Through collaboration, the industry stands a better chance of making it all work.\nOf course, you can't spend ages negotiating a big partnership just to sum it all up like that. No, you have to tick off buzzwords like AI, and hammer home the point about how great this is for 5G. It's all relevant, of course, but it somewhat clouds (geddit?) the more important issues. Extra tuition\nAn equally interesting strand to this partnership relates to tooling up and skilling up. It couldn't be more obvious from AT&T's announcement \u2013 and the partnership announced earlier this week with IBM \u2013 that the telco is following through with its major commitment to cloud.\nUnder its 'public cloud first' strategy, AT&T plans to shift most of its non network workloads to the public cloud by 2024. Its partnership with Microsoft will see AT&T equip staff with Microsoft 365, and migrate non network infrastructure applications to Azure.\nWhat has become obvious then, is that while once upon a time, AT&T's major commitment to cloud would have involved capex, and building or acquiring data centres, now it necessitates broad and deep partnerships with experts in the field, highlighting how telcos \u2013 even giants like AT&T \u2013 have missed their window for becoming the experts themselves.\nAs Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella put it: \"The world's leading companies run on our cloud, and we are delighted that AT&T chose Microsoft to accelerate its innovation. Together, we will apply the power of Azure and Microsoft 365 to transform the way AT&T's workforce collaborates and to shape the future of media and communications for people everywhere.\" Related Topics", "URL": "https://www.telecomtv.com/content/edge/at-t-microsoft-sharpen-their-edge-with-mega-partnership-35814/"}, {"Title": "Windows Server 2008 End of Life & Microsoft Helps Nunavut Recover: FoxNet IT Round Up", "Text": "Microsoft Steps in to Help Nunavut Deal with Ransomware Fallout The Nunavut government experienced a ransomware attack in early November which affected their public services department.

Hyperscale Data Centres for the World's Largest Cloud Providers\nUnder the terms of the agreement, GIC is purchasing an 80 percent equity interest in the joint venture, while Equinix will sell two data centres in London and Paris to the new entity, as well as other development interests, in exchange for the remaining 20 percent in equity.\n\"As a long term value investor, we are confident that the strong growth in data consumption and public cloud data storage will continue to drive secular demand for hyperscale data centers,\" said Lee Kok Sun, chief investment officer of GIC Real Estate. \"We believe the venture portfolio, which is well located in the primary European data center hubs and under the management of an established partner such as Equinix, will generate steady and resilient returns in the long run. The Equinix Sydney SY4 hyperscale data centre\nThe Redwood based company, which has a portfolio of 200 data centres worldwide and has already partnered with Alibaba Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, will use the investment to fund development of four of the company's xScale line of hyperscale data centres in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London.\nMeasuring tens of thousands of square metres, and packed with thousands of servers, routers and other networking gear, Equinix targets its largest data centres to the requirements of the world's data cloud giants. Lendlease to Expand its APAC Footprint\nWhile GIC and its new partner target the European market, Lendlease, which had 61 percent of its A$7.6 billion ($5.3 billion) in assets in Australia and Asia at the end of last year, is aiming to expand that portfolio into the data centre segment.\n\"A data centre platform is a strategic fit for the Group, aligning with our targeted key trend of infrastructure, our telecommunications strategy and our integrated business model,\" Lendlease's chief executive officer for Asia, Tony Lombardo said.\nThe Lendlease Asia chief added that the developer was targeting the server farms because of the strong growth potential of the sector, which is evolving into a mainstream real estate asset class.\nThe $1 billion deal will be the Sydney headquartered developer's first foray into the data centre segment in Asia Pacific, targetting projects in Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore.\nThe company said in its announcement that the partnership will be funded 20 percent by Lendlease and 80 percent by its institutional partner, with an initial equity commitment by the parties of $500 million. Investor Appetite for Data Centres Shows No Signs of Slowing\nThe pair of initiatives come as investors continue to show an appetite for data centres in the region. A report released in October last year by market research firm Arizton projects growth of more than 12 percent annually in APAC through 2023.\nJust two weeks ago, GIC entered into a partnership with data centre provider Polymer Connected to build a hyperscale data centre campus in Jakarta, while just a week earlier New York Stock Exchange listed Digital Realty entered a 50/50 joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation to build a data centre in Tokyo that will be capable of delivering over 35 megawatts of capacity by 2021.\nThese deals followed the announcement in September last year that Facebook had chosen Singapore as the site of its first billion dollar data centre in Asia, with an 11 storey, 170,000 square metre (1.8 million square feet) structure in the industrial district of Jurong East, slated to be operational in 2022. That project by the social media giant will neighbour Google's existing two data centres in Jurong West.

Many companies turn to external partners for innovation efforts, such as accelerators and innovation labs, while another approach is to promote internal entrepreneurship, also known as intrapreneurship. One has a manager with entrepreneur focus, the other a manager as entrepreneur emphasis. But which is more effective?\nWhile it's important for companies to prioritize these approaches to best suit their resources, one misstep organizations take is treating intrapreneurship programs and external partnerships as purely an either/or choice.\nThe problem is more common than you'd think. A manager from the intrapreneurship team of a large global company once asked me to recommend an accelerator he could talk to, completely ignorant of the fact that the startup partnering division of his own company was already working closely with one. This siloed approach to external startup engagement and intrapreneurship illustrates the dangers of treating innovation options as mutually exclusive.\nTo avoid losing innovation opportunities, managers should follow three approaches for effectively deploying people, resources, and capabilities.\nEmpower intrapreneurs to drive startup engagement. Over the past decade, I've conducted more than 200 interviews with multinational executives, startup entrepreneurs, accelerator managers, government officials, and industry experts from around the world about their expanding entrepreneurial efforts. Many of the internal leaders I've met who have entrepreneurial bents serve as the catalyst for partnering with startups. One example is former Microsoft corporate vice president Dan'l Lewin, a well known Silicon Valley entrepreneur who joined Microsoft in 2001 and launched two pioneering programs, BizSpark and BizSpark One, which established Microsoft's venture capital and startup community engagement efforts across six continents in over 150 locations.\nLewin started by introducing the BizSpark breadth program for startups working on the Microsoft stack and built on that success with the BizSpark One depth program, which identified the 100 most innovative startups from among Microsoft's thousands of BizSpark member startups. Each member of the select BizSpark One group received business mentoring as well as technical and marketing support from a designated portfolio manager. This program allowed Microsoft to collaborate closely with highly innovative partners \u2014 including StorSimple, a Silicon Valley startup offering cloud integrated storage solutions, which Microsoft went on to acquire, and Gridsum, a Beijing based startup that became a standout partner in China and helped establish Microsoft's credibility as a valuable startup partner in that market.\nOrganizations seeking to speed product development by working with startups should cultivate and empower their own internal entrepreneurs to drive this process. Lewin expanded Microsoft's global innovation efforts exponentially by directing and supporting the intrapreneurial efforts of junior colleagues both at corporate headquarters and in global subsidiaries. One such empowered intrapreneur, Zack Weisfeld, launched an accelerator to partner with startups face to face for a shorter period of time (four months) at Microsoft's R&D facility in Israel. Inspired by Weisfeld's efforts, Microsoft's R&D units in India and China soon followed suit, launching accelerators in Bangalore and Beijing. Weisfeld was ultimately given global responsibility for managing Microsoft's startup engagement, including the Microsoft Accelerator program, which has been ranked among the most successful accelerators in the world in terms of the number of startups accelerated and positioned Microsoft as a desirable partner in the startup community.\nMake the same resources available internally and externally. By sharing the same resources \u2014 such as training programs, co working spaces, and startup mentors \u2014 with both intrapreneurs and external partners, companies can reduce costs while scaling innovation. Bosch, for example, utilizes the very same training program and resources for internal employees pursuing entrepreneurial efforts as in its accelerator program for external startups. Sheelpa Patel, cofounder of Infiniti Lab, an accelerator for external startups working with Nissan's luxury car brand in Hong Kong, reduced costs by extending the same pitch training program to internal employees with intrapreneurial ideas. Additionally, said Patel, \"Infiniti achieved the highest level of engagement scores ever as employees were so keen and passionate to become part of this intrapreneurship initiative.\"\nIn some cases, companies go a step further and bring together combined cohorts of intrapreneurs and external entrepreneurs under the same roof. Although not always feasible owing to, say, security concerns, selectively mixing these groups can imbue the company's culture with an increased sense of entrepreneurialism. Bayer's G4A (previously Grants4Apps) program, which was initiated by Bayer intrapreneur Jesus del Valle, accepted an internal team into its Berlin startup accelerator alongside external startups. Bayer was able to leverage the internal talent pool to tap one of the team members to run a similar accelerator program targeting external startups for another subsidiary within the company.\nFostering intrapreneurs by giving them access to the same training and resources supplied to external startup partners can result in even greater employee engagement with outside startups and fuel a self propelling cycle of continuous innovation.\nCoca Cola's Founders program achieved success by integrating intrapreneurship and external startup engagement resources over time. The company hired entrepreneurs from around the world to explore novel business ideas and models as Coca Cola employees. For these intrapreneurs, the challenge was to find untapped revenue streams using Coca Cola's extensive asset base. The model eventually morphed into one in which the intrapreneurs were spun off into external startups that continued to utilize resources from Coca Cola over a period of two years, in much the same way as they did within Coca Cola.\nThrough this process, Jason Hosking, one of the first entrepreneurs brought in to launch the Founders program, became the CEO of Hivery, an AI/analytics startup that emerged from the Founders program. Today, the startup boasts an impressive list of corporate clients around the globe, including Coca Cola; has grown to a 40 employee organization; and is scaling globally. But the starting point was an intrapreneurship program that evolved into an external startup engagement program, with resources seamlessly integrated across both initiatives.\nEncourage collaboration between internal and external innovators. In addition to creating a culture of cooperation and transparency, empowering internal innovation teams and external startups to collaborate can increase efficiency and reduce time to market for new services and products.\nTake, for example, Intel's GrowthX intrapreneurship program, formerly known as Ideas2Reality (I2R), in China. The team was working on facial recognition technology to operate smart doors that let users into their homes simply by smiling at a camera and was on the lookout for an OEM partner to codevelop the solution and bring it to market. Curbing the instinct to partner with a known supplier, which seems less risky owing to a shared vocabulary and prior experience working together, Kapil Kane, director of innovation, Intel China, connected the team with LifeSmart, an external startup in Hangzhou. Kane found LifeSmart a good fit because \"they were one of the rising stars in the smart home space in China\" and shared complementary capabilities: Intel's intrapreneurship team's expertise in relevant components such as cameras, chips, and algorithms could be combined with LifeSmart's design, manufacturing, and marketing competence.\nThe result? The team launched the final product within three months, much faster than the internal team would likely have achieved on its own. More broadly, the learning outcome was tremendous. Building a minimum viable product (MVP) collaboratively with LifeSmart led Kane to realize that bringing together intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs was a good way to accelerate innovation and led to several similar partnerships.\nWhile the benefits of such partnerships may seem obvious, managers may miss out on opportunities simply because they're unaware they exist. To stay abreast of industry opportunities, Eugene Borukhovich, head of Bayer's G4A digital health team, streamlined the activities under three broad pillars: intelligence (\"where to play\" \u2014 understanding value pools, unmet needs, and strategic imperatives), partnerships (\"who to play with\" \u2014 including commercial deals with and early stage investments in startups), and ventures (\"how to win\" \u2014 developing new revenue streams). These categories clarify strategy for innovation similar to Roger Martin's \"cascading choices\" framework. In the ventures category, Borukhovich and his team's first foray into identifying a new business involved creating a team of entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs, which Borukhovich anticipates will make the team nimbler and increase Bayer's odds of quickly finding solutions to address identified business opportunities that improve patients' experience of health.\nWhereas the previous Intel example is one of an intrapreneurship program reaching out to external startups, Bayer is the reverse \u2014 a startup program now involving intrapreneurs. Effective collaboration flows both ways.\nDriving corporate innovation is not a case of picking either intrapreneurship or external startup partnering \u2014 you need both. And it's not enough to have intrapreneurs and external partners working separately, in parallel \u2013 although separate teams leading these initiatives may still make sense. To stay ahead of the competition, companies must recognize the ways in which these teams intersect and take advantage of the benefits associated with combining people, resources, and capabilities. Going beyond either/or thinking to embrace both internal and external entrepreneurs is likely to give your company a bigger bang for its corporate innovation buck.\nThe article first appeared in MIT Sloan Management Review.

A manager from the intrapreneurship team of a large global company once asked me to recommend an accelerator he could talk to, completely ignorant of the fact that the startup partnering division of his own company was already working closely with one. This siloed approach to external startup engagement and intrapreneurship illustrates the dangers of treating innovation options as mutually exclusive.\nTo avoid losing innovation opportunities, managers should follow three approaches for effectively deploying people, resources, and capabilities.\nEmpower intrapreneurs to drive startup engagement. Over the past decade, I've conducted more than 200 interviews with multinational executives, startup entrepreneurs, accelerator managers, government officials, and industry experts from around the world about their expanding entrepreneurial efforts. Many of the internal leaders I've met who have entrepreneurial bents serve as the catalyst for partnering with startups. One example is former Microsoft corporate vice president Dan'l Lewin, a well known Silicon Valley entrepreneur who joined Microsoft in 2001 and launched two pioneering programs, BizSpark and BizSpark One, which established Microsoft's venture capital and startup community engagement efforts across six continents in over 150 locations.\nLewin started by introducing the BizSpark breadth program for startups working on the Microsoft stack and built on that success with the BizSpark One depth program, which identified the 100 most innovative startups from among Microsoft's thousands of BizSpark member startups. Each member of the select BizSpark One group received business mentoring as well as technical and marketing support from a designated portfolio manager. This program allowed Microsoft to collaborate closely with highly innovative partners \u2014 including StorSimple, a Silicon Valley startup offering cloud integrated storage solutions, which Microsoft went on to acquire, and Gridsum, a Beijing based startup that became a standout partner in China and helped establish Microsoft's credibility as a valuable startup partner in that market.\nOrganizations seeking to speed product development by working with startups should cultivate and empower their own internal entrepreneurs to drive this process. Lewin expanded Microsoft's global innovation efforts exponentially by directing and supporting the intrapreneurial efforts of junior colleagues both at corporate headquarters and in global subsidiaries. One such empowered intrapreneur, Zack Weisfeld, launched an accelerator to partner with startups face to face for a shorter period of time (four months) at Microsoft's R&D facility in Israel. Inspired by Weisfeld's efforts, Microsoft's R&D units in India and China soon followed suit, launching accelerators in Bangalore and Beijing. Weisfeld was ultimately given global responsibility for managing Microsoft's startup engagement, including the Microsoft Accelerator program, which has been ranked among the most successful accelerators in the world in terms of the number of startups accelerated and positioned Microsoft as a desirable partner in the startup community.\nMake the same resources available internally and externally. By sharing the same resources \u2014 such as training programs, co working spaces, and startup mentors \u2014 with both intrapreneurs and external partners, companies can reduce costs while scaling innovation. Bosch, for example, utilizes the very same training program and resources for internal employees pursuing entrepreneurial efforts as in its accelerator program for external startups. Sheelpa Patel, cofounder of Infiniti Lab, an accelerator for external startups working with Nissan's luxury car brand in Hong Kong, reduced costs by extending the same pitch training program to internal employees with intrapreneurial ideas. Additionally, said Patel, \"Infiniti achieved the highest level of engagement scores ever as employees were so keen and passionate to become part of this intrapreneurship initiative.\"\nIn some cases, companies go a step further and bring together combined cohorts of intrapreneurs and external entrepreneurs under the same roof. Although not always feasible owing to, say, security concerns, selectively mixing these groups can imbue the company's culture with an increased sense of entrepreneurialism. Bayer's G4A (previously Grants4Apps) program, which was initiated by Bayer intrapreneur Jesus del Valle, accepted an internal team into its Berlin startup accelerator alongside external startups. Bayer was able to leverage the internal talent pool to tap one of the team members to run a similar accelerator program targeting external startups for another subsidiary within the company.\nFostering intrapreneurs by giving them access to the same training and resources supplied to external startup partners can result in even greater employee engagement with outside startups and fuel a self propelling cycle of continuous innovation.\nCoca Cola's Founders program achieved success by integrating intrapreneurship and external startup engagement resources over time. The company hired entrepreneurs from around the world to explore novel business ideas and models as Coca Cola employees. For these intrapreneurs, the challenge was to find untapped revenue streams using Coca Cola's extensive asset base. The model eventually morphed into one in which the intrapreneurs were spun off into external startups that continued to utilize resources from Coca Cola over a period of two years, in much the same way as they did within Coca Cola.\nThrough this process, Jason Hosking, one of the first entrepreneurs brought in to launch the Founders program, became the CEO of Hivery, an AI/analytics startup that emerged from the Founders program. Today, the startup boasts an impressive list of corporate clients around the globe, including Coca Cola; has grown to a 40 employee organization; and is scaling globally. But the starting point was an intrapreneurship program that evolved into an external startup engagement program, with resources seamlessly integrated across both initiatives.\nEncourage collaboration between internal and external innovators. In addition to creating a culture of cooperation and transparency, empowering internal innovation teams and external startups to collaborate can increase efficiency and reduce time to market for new services and products.\nTake, for example, Intel's GrowthX intrapreneurship program, formerly known as Ideas2Reality (I2R), in China. The team was working on facial recognition technology to operate smart doors that let users into their homes simply by smiling at a camera and was on the lookout for an OEM partner to codevelop the solution and bring it to market. Curbing the instinct to partner with a known supplier, which seems less risky owing to a shared vocabulary and prior experience working together, Kapil Kane, director of innovation, Intel China, connected the team with LifeSmart, an external startup in Hangzhou. Kane found LifeSmart a good fit because \"they were one of the rising stars in the smart home space in China\" and shared complementary capabilities: Intel's intrapreneurship team's expertise in relevant components such as cameras, chips, and algorithms could be combined with LifeSmart's design, manufacturing, and marketing competence.\nThe result? The team launched the final product within three months, much faster than the internal team would likely have achieved on its own. More broadly, the learning outcome was tremendous. Building a minimum viable product (MVP) collaboratively with LifeSmart led Kane to realize that bringing together intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs was a good way to accelerate innovation and led to several similar partnerships.\nWhile the benefits of such partnerships may seem obvious, managers may miss out on opportunities simply because they're unaware they exist. To stay abreast of industry opportunities, Eugene Borukhovich, head of Bayer's G4A digital health team, streamlined the activities under three broad pillars: intelligence (\"where to play\" \u2014 understanding value pools, unmet needs, and strategic imperatives), partnerships (\"who to play with\" \u2014 including commercial deals with and early stage investments in startups), and ventures (\"how to win\" \u2014 developing new revenue streams). These categories clarify strategy for innovation similar to Roger Martin's \"cascading choices\" framework. In the ventures category, Borukhovich and his team's first foray into identifying a new business involved creating a team of entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs, which Borukhovich anticipates will make the team nimbler and increase Bayer's odds of quickly finding solutions to address identified business opportunities that improve patients' experience of health.\nWhereas the previous Intel example is one of an intrapreneurship program reaching out to external startups, Bayer is the reverse \u2014 a startup program now involving intrapreneurs. Effective collaboration flows both ways.\nDriving corporate innovation is not a case of picking either intrapreneurship or external startup partnering \u2014 you need both. And it's not enough to have intrapreneurs and external partners working separately, in parallel \u2013 although separate teams leading these initiatives may still make sense. To stay ahead of the competition, companies must recognize the ways in which these teams intersect and take advantage of the benefits associated with combining people, resources, and capabilities. Going beyond either/or thinking to embrace both internal and external entrepreneurs is likely to give your company a bigger bang for its corporate innovation buck.\nThe article first appeared in MIT Sloan Management Review.

By Aman Singh May 17, 2019\nThe gaming industry is all set to see a huge change as two of the biggest games and consoles makers have entered into a strategic partnership. This week, Sony and Microsoft announced that they were partnering up to use each other's services and platforms to develop new image sensors. As a part of this partnership, Sony would use Microsoft's cloud for streaming games and media.\nThe partnership is still in its early stages, and many aspects of it have not been determined as of now. But two of the biggest players in the gaming and interactive entertainment services would team up and bring their resources together to develop and make new development tools for game developers.\nSony is the maker of PlayStation consoles and other games while Microsoft is the owner of Xbox consoles, games and many other services. They both hold high regards and respect among the tech and gaming industry. In a statement, the CEO of Sony Kenichiro Yoshida said, \"For many years, Microsoft has been a key business partner for us, though of course the two companies have also been competing in some areas. I believe that our joint development of future cloud solutions will contribute greatly to the advancement of interactive content.\"\nThis deal would strengthen Microsoft's Azure cloud computing business which was one of the reasons Microsoft became a trillion dollar company. Teaming up of both the company would be helpful for business and their own technologies for both the companies.\nOn the other hand, Sony, a Japanese electronics maker has already been in talks about the leaks of its upcoming PlayStation 5. It has also been a major developer of camera chips for smartphones and digital cameras. Sony's partnership with Microsoft will help it develop new image sensors. These sensors will use Microsoft's artificial intelligence technology for business customers.\nBoth companies also said that they will explore how to use Microsoft's AI tools and technologies in Sony's consumer products.

However, Sony's own PlayStation division was surprised to hear about this deal.\nAccording to a Bloomberg report , Sony and Microsoft have agreed on a deal that involves sharing cloud servers. In this deal, Sony is paying their way to have a share in Microsoft's cloud server system, Azure. Bloomberg notes that this move could be Sony's way to assure the cloud gaming end of their services in the future.\nHowever, some PlayStation employees were surprised with this decision. None of them knew about this plan, and so they were worried that it could affect the development of their games. Bloomberg's unnamed inside sources say that the situation is under control and this deal would not affect any development inside PlayStation.\nPrior to relying on Microsoft Azure for cloud gaming , Sony and PlayStation were the first to introduce cloud gaming services through PlayStation Now. Players subscribed to the platform would be able to play games even when miles away from their home consoles. However, one of its flaws is its in house servers are prone to experiencing connection problems that ruin the game streaming experience.\nAs Sony relies on Microsoft for its cloud gaming, the market rivalry for these two console giants takes on a different turn. Bloomberg's report notes that Microsoft has the upper hand on business end since Sony has to pay for its cloud gaming services even though they are direct competitors in the console market. It all rests on Sony to keep earning big.\nSo far, Sony has better popularity than Microsoft in the console market due to its exclusive PlayStation games. While Xbox One is known for its better performance, its lack of exclusives makes customers think twice while Sony keeps releasing award winning exclusives such as \"Bloodborne\" and the new \"God of War.\" At best, this cloud gaming deal will further tighten the competition between the two companies in the console market.\nPictured: A fan making their way down an esculator with PS4 branding before the UEFA Champions League Final between Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool at Estadio Wanda Metropolitano on June 1, 2019 in Madrid, Spain. Photo: Getty Images/Robbie Jay Barratt AMA\nFor now, we'll have to see what Microsoft has in store in E3 2019 if they're going to talk this deal with Sony on their press conference. Sony would not make an appearance this year due to their interest in pushing out the PlayStation \"State of Play\" livestreams. We can only wait on how PlayStation processes this whole deal on their end too.

Soon, our inbox was flooded with people proclaiming their leader, charitable giving program, and innovations were tops. Now, after much deliberation, we are ready to reveal the best of the best in our five diverse categories celebrating all the Eastside has to offer. LEADER OF THE YEAR WINNER: Benson Porter, President and CEO of BECU Photo by Jeff Hobson\nIt makes sense that BECU , a company founded on the core idea of people helping people, is under the leadership of President and CEO Benson Porter \u2014 someone who has dedicated his life to serving communities and helping people.\nPorter grew up in the coastal town of Aberdeen, where he helped at the family business, Benson's Office Supply, throughout his high school years. It was there he developed an interest in community engagement, something he carried with him into his future endeavors.\nHe attended Whitman College and studied economics, and as he began to think about a future career realized that when it came to serving communities, he wanted to deal with the financial side of things. This combination led Porter into a successful career that included serving as president and CEO of First Tech Credit Union, and chief administrative officer for Washington Mutual. It was in 2012 that Porter took on his current position at BECU \u2014 a company that has been serving the Pacific Northwest since 1935.\nThough lauded for his leadership, Porter humbly credits the success of the institution to its employees and members.\n\"At BECU, giving back is in our DNA, and we're passionate about serving our local communities, including those on the Eastside. Providing our members with easy access to the tools and services they need to thrive and live financially healthy lives is one of our primary areas of focus and wouldn't be made possible without the hard work and dedication of all BECU employees and the support of our members,\" he said.\nPorter has more than 25 years of experience within the financial services industry and serves on multiple boards, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle/Des Moines, CO OP Financial Services, CU Direct, and Overseers of Whitman College. FINALIST: Char Patterson, Managing Principal of JPC Courtesy JPC Architects\nFor an example of a true leader, one who inspires everyone around her to work harder and smarter, look no further than Char Patterson, managing principal of JPC Architects. \"She is an incredible example of how a woman can be successful in a career that is often dominated by men and a wonderful resource for women that are aspiring to achieve her level of success,\" wrote nominator Melanie Pitsch, who serves as the human resources manager at JPC. Patterson has been performing commercial, residential, municipal, and industrial work with JPC since 1994 and has been a partner since 2006. During that time, Patterson has worked with such clients as Schnitzer Northwest, John L. Scott Real Estate, Cingular Wireless, Wyndham, and many more. FINALIST: Brent Frei, CEO of TerraClear Photo by Rachel Coward\nBrent Frei is more than a leader \u2014 he's an innovator. Frei currently is the mastermind behind TerraClear , a Bellevue based company that aims to map, identify, and remove rocks from farmland through the use of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, drones, and automation. Frei grew up in a small Idaho farming community, so he knows firsthand how backbreaking the rock picking process can be. After stepping away from Smartsheet, a Bellevue based online project management software company he helped found, Frei returned to his hometown and quickly realized there had to be a better way to perform the tedious, time consuming work of pulling rocks from the soil. Thus, he set out to put together a team and founded TerraClear in 2017.\nWINNER: Funko Photo by Jeff Hobson\nFor a company literally founded on fun \u2014 Funko founder Mike Becker has publicly stated that his company name stands for \"fun company\" \u2014 and rooted in pop culture, it comes as no surprise that the Everett based collectibles company has an office as funky and friendly as the iconic Pop! figures it creates.\nThe 88,000 square foot Wetmore Avenue fixture lures the denizens of Everett and beckons foreign and domestic travelers to its ground floor retail shop by presenting itself as a pop culture mecca. Inside, visitors are greeted by larger than life characters like a playful, wall climbing Spider Man and a menacing, imprisoned Joker. Fans can even take a selfie with Godzilla, hop in the Batmobile, or hang in Diagon Alley with \"The Boy Who Lived.\"\nAnd many other amazing, pop culture infused innovations are placed where no fan could go \u2014 the upstairs offices where 300 of Funko's more than 800 employees work.\n\"For innovation to flourish, it needs creativity, passion, and room to grow,\" Funko CEO Brian Mariotti said of the company's offices. \"All of these are alive and thriving in Everett.\"\nThere are Hanna Barbera themed conference rooms, jungle themed bathrooms (including a jungle soundtrack on loop), a photo and video studio, and a massive lounge on the second floor where employees can have lunch or chat with co workers.\nBut what really puts Funko over the top as an office space are the metal slides situated alongside each staircase on floors three, four, and five. Employees reminiscing of bygone carefree days on the playground can opt to zoom down the slide if they are running late for a meeting \u2014 or if they are just in need of an adrenaline rush.\nNeed more? The basement \u2014 or lower level \u2014 contains a modestly sized company gym and locker room, an arcade with classic cabinet games and pinball machines (all free, of course), and a lounge with plush purple couches and Hanna Barbera character portraits. But the real MVP of Funko's lower level is Funko Lanes, where several of the company's bowling teams maintain lively rivalries. FINALIST: Expedia Photo courtesy Expedia\nWe know Expedia is beginning its move across the lake, but we just can't get enough of the global travel company's current Bellevue office. Developed by the expert creatives at JPC Architects, Expedia's current home base was created with a global employee base in mind. \"To achieve this, JPC created distinct areas within the floor that support various traditional and nontraditional workstyles and can evolve with the company, culture, and future,\" JPC Marketing Manager Amanda Tallman wrote in her nomination. Notable attributes include huddle rooms, semi private collaboration booths, and library worktables, in addition to more traditional, yet beautiful, workstations and meeting rooms. Oh, and what's a travel company without a centrally located Tiki lounge where employees can quench a premeeting caffeine fix? Yeah, Expedia has got that, too. FINALIST: Inteum Photo courtesy Inteum\nMany of Inteum 's core employees have been with the Kirkland based software development company for more than a decade, and more still have crossed the five year threshold. What contributes to this longevity? Certainly, the company's innovative technology, accessibility, leadership, and loyal client base play a pivotal role. But we would be remiss if we didn't list Inteum's warm, bright office space as a factor, too. After all, it's all about location, location, location. Situated in a walkable neighborhood, the workspace gives employees their pick of nearby caf\u00e9s, pubs, and even a wood fired pizza kitchen. The office itself radiates warmth with its northwest facing windows overlooking Kirkland's Juanita Creek and glass office walls to allow as much natural light in as possible. And the option of a creekside patio can't be beat when compared to a stuffy conference room on a summer day. LEGACY BUSINESS OF THE YEAR WINNER: SanMar Coporation Photo by Jeff Hobson\nIn 1971, when Marty Lott started SanMar Corporation from his parents' Seattle basement, he didn't know he was creating a multigenerational legacy business. Nor did he realize that his T shirt company would grow into an apparel icon. But it has achieved both \u2014 and much more.\nSanMar, a blank garment and soft goods wholesale supplier, today employs more than 4,000 people and carries nearly two dozen retail, mill, and private label brands.\nAnd Lott still is an active leader in the company, along with sons, Jeremy and Jordan.\n\"We sell to people that either put a logo on shirts or resell it out,\" said Jeremy Lott, who serves as SanMar's president. \"If Microsoft is launching a product, they would buy those goods from one of our customers.\"\nAccording to Lott, the family came with an excellent role model. \"Grandpa was an entrepreneur,\" Marty Lott shared. \"He didn't have money and believed if it didn't work, he wasn't any worse off than he was when he started.\"\nMarty Lott indicated SanMar's goal is to, \"always be a leader, whether it be product, technology, or new services to the market,\" and also stated, \"SanMar's leadership isn't afraid to reinvent what the business is or what it's going to look like, and even though the business may change dramatically, the core values that have been the same for the last 50 years won't.\"\nSanMar's values were founded on kindness, Marty Lott explained, sharing it shows through in everything from the company's market presence to its people. \"We've attracted people who want to work in a company where others treat them nicely and there's a family atmosphere,\" he said.\nAccording to Marty Lott, SanMar's social responsibility program, Canvas for Good, was designed to spread kindness. \"We want to make an impact in the health and well being of the people that make our apparel products and positively impact the communities they live in,\" he said.\n\"It's not just about what we do, but also about our customers, and Canvas for Good is the way we tell those stories with a sense of community and pride,\" he concluded. \"A T shirt can do great things.\" FINALIST: Tripe XXX Drive In Photo by Triple XXX Root Beer\nTriple XXX Drive In 's roots stretch back to the first drive in restaurant in the Pacific Northwest in 1930, which sold Triple XXX Root Beer. In fact, the Issaquah Triple XXX is the only place you still can find the traditional XXX barrel the drink came from. The original restaurant was simply referred to as \"The Barrel\" by locals before moving in 1968 to its current location. While most Triple XXX restaurants eventually gave way to the trend of contemporary fast food outlets, this original Eastside business still thrives. FINALIST: Taco Time Northwest Photo courtesy Taco Time NW\nThe first Taco Time Northwest location opened in 1962, when Frank Tonkin Sr. became a pioneer in quick service Mexican restaurants. But the family's entrepreneurial roots in Renton date back more than 135 years, to when the current generation's great great great grandfather founded a small general store there. Today, cousins Chris and Robby Tonkin stand at the helm of their family's Taco Time Northwest legacy with 79 Western Washington restaurants \u2014 56 are family owned, while the remaining locations are franchised \u2014 and more than 2,000 employees. MOST INNOVATIVE WINNER: Quris Photo courtesy Tactuum\nIn a field where timely access to accurate information is a matter of life or death, Bellevue based Tactuum is transforming patient care at some of the country's top medical institutions.\nThe tech company's flagship product, Quris Clinical Companion, is a multifaceted, versatile platform that puts critical information at medical professionals' fingertips. The platform unlocks access to patient information and serves as a comprehensive reference guide, bringing the data that medical professionals need to one easily accessible location. Quris has been adopted by 44,000 medical professionals across the United States and is transforming approaches toward everything from emergency management to antimicrobial stewardship.\nTactuum was originally formed in 2012 by a team of healthcare and tech industry veterans, and one of its first projects was adopting a clinical book into an online format. Once published, clinical information quickly becomes obsolete, so the goal was to create a reference guide that could constantly be updated. Soon after, the company took on projects with University Medical Center New Orleans and the University of Washington.\nAs solutions director and cofounder Neil Francoeur explained, \"Since then, that's what our focus has been, getting information to the clinician in times of need.\"\nQuris' app and web platform, built in partnership with Microsoft, can be downloaded straight to clinicians' phones. The application streamlines and centralizes the information that medical practitioners need to implement the highest level of patient care. This has made Quris a critical tool for resident doctors and medical students. It also has been adopted by UW Medicine's Airlift Northwest program due to its offline capabilities, which get life saving information to physicians faster. Other popular uses of the app include critical care, emergency management, and helping practitioners determine the correct course of treatment for a patient.\nAccording to Francoeur, creating partnerships with cutting edge research institutions like the University of Washington has been key to innovating. \"When we started this adventure, I would have never thought we were going to be in helicopters,\" Francoeur said. But by tailoring the app to fit a variety of healthcare information needs, Tactuum has created an invaluable tool for medical professionals that is transforming patient outcomes across the country. FINALIST: Acumatica Photo courtesy Acumatica\nWhen it launched in 2008, Acumatica 's cloud based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software was considered a significant bet. \"It seems obvious now, but 11 plus years ago, there (were) still a lot of people running around saying this cloud thing isn't real,\" said CEO Jon Roskill. In the years since, the company has stayed true to its cutting edge roots; it was the first ERP system to do an Amazon Alexa integration and is rolling out innovations in AI and machine learning. But as Roskill explained, \"We're not just doing technical innovation. We're also innovating in the business side of software.\" The company recently released a Consumer Bill of Rights that challenges others in the industry to adopt its consumer friendly practices, such as unchanging End User License Agreements and usage based pricing. FINALIST: Essentia Water Photo courtesy Essentia Water\nEssentia Water 's CEO & founder Ken Uptain introduced alkaline water to the U.S. market when he launched the company in 1998. Most alkaline water brands wouldn't pop up until 10 years later, and as Uptain explained, Essentia Water's ionization process continues to set it apart. \"(Other companies) basically are putting minerals in the water to raise the pH but what we do is use technology and remove the acidic ions from the water and bottle more alkaline ions, which raise the pH. At the same time, we change the structure of the water, so it becomes more hydrating, more absorbing.\" One 2016 clinical trial showed Essentia Water hydrated 88 percent more effectively than the leading bottled water brand. MOST PHILANTHROPIC WINNER: Mox Boarding House Photo by Rodrigo DeMedeiros\nFor six years, a yearly gaming tournament like no other has been held where there's much more than a trophy at stake. In fact, the main purpose of Mox Boarding House 's Gauntlet gaming tournament is to raise money for local nonprofits.\nThis year, the mid May event raised $116,992 for an organization called El Centro de la Raza, which provides low income students throughout King County with mentors and tutors.\n\"I'm just really excited to see how people have embraced this event,\" said Lyla Ross, program manager for ENGAGE, Mox Boarding House's charitable giving arm that sponsors other charitable tournaments like The Chalice. Ross' husband co owns the company, and she is a former clinical social worker. \"I hoped it would be a fun thing and that our friends would want to be a part of it. But it has really become a thing that people in our industry are interested in doing.\"\nThe event is organized by ENGAGE, the gaming company's community outreach committee, which Ross proposed back in 2012 and now manages part time. On top of the Gauntlet itself, the company sets a quarterly budget to donate games to local charitable organizations, provide meeting spaces for nonprofits, and organize donation drives.\nThe tournament itself, however, takes the cake for the most creative and exciting avenue for Mox Boarding House to give back. Prior to the competition beginning, 20 teams of four players are required to fundraise for six weeks within their communities. The more money they raise, Ross said, the more advantages they have in the tournament. For the sixth year in a row, Team Bungie (from the company of the same name) raised the most money \u2014 $70,000.\nOn the day of the tournament, which took place this year on May 19 at Mox's Bellevue location, teams played board games, circus trivia, and carnival games, round robin style.\nOrganizations that have benefited from the unique fundraiser include Wellspring Family Services, Treehouse, YouthCare, and Hopelink. ENGAGE has raised almost $695,000 in in six years. \u2014 ZB FINALIST: Merrill Lynch Photo by Jeff Hobson\nThe Bank of America Charitable Gift Fund helps customers maximize their giving to meaningful causes and offers specialized investment management through Merrill Lynch 's financial services division, or online with its self directed investing platform, Merrill Edge. The fund strategizes charitable giving and keeps track of each year's income tax deduction for contributions made. Additionally, the company's employees support such local charitable causes as the Festival of Trees, The Boys & Girls Clubs of King County, Seattle Goodwill, Washington Autism Alliance & Advocacy, Food Lifeline, and more. FINALIST: Green Theory Photo by Rachel Coward\nBellevue's Green Theory opened in 2015 as the city's first recreational cannabis store. It does a lot more than just sell marijuana based products, though: The retailer has its heart in philanthropic efforts. Each October for the last three years, Green Theory has raised money to support cancer awareness and research with its Cannabis for a Cause program. Beneficiaries of donations from this event and from other year round giving include Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Bellevue LifeSpring, Motley Zoo Animal Rescue, and Northwest Harvest.", "URL": "https://425business.com/2019-idea-awards/"}, {"Title": "2019 IDEA Awards", "Text": "We asked our readers to nominate their favorites in a range of categories: innovation, family businesses with the most august histories, the coolest office spaces \u2014 and more \u2014 for our third annual Innovation, Distinction, Excellence, and Achievement \u2014 or IDEA \u2014 Awards.

But it has really become a thing that people in our industry are interested in doing.\"\nThe event is organized by ENGAGE, the gaming company's community outreach committee, which Ross proposed back in 2012 and now manages part time. On top of the Gauntlet itself, the company sets a quarterly budget to donate games to local charitable organizations, provide meeting spaces for nonprofits, and organize donation drives.\nThe tournament itself, however, takes the cake for the most creative and exciting avenue for Mox Boarding House to give back. Prior to the competition beginning, 20 teams of four players are required to fundraise for six weeks within their communities. The more money they raise, Ross said, the more advantages they have in the tournament. For the sixth year in a row, Team Bungie (from the company of the same name) raised the most money \u2014 $70,000.\nOn the day of the tournament, which took place this year on May 19 at Mox's Bellevue location, teams played board games, circus trivia, and carnival games, round robin style.\nOrganizations that have benefited from the unique fundraiser include Wellspring Family Services, Treehouse, YouthCare, and Hopelink. ENGAGE has raised almost $695,000 in in six years. \u2014 ZB FINALIST: Merrill Lynch Photo by Jeff Hobson\nThe Bank of America Charitable Gift Fund helps customers maximize their giving to meaningful causes and offers specialized investment management through Merrill Lynch 's financial services division, or online with its self directed investing platform, Merrill Edge. The fund strategizes charitable giving and keeps track of each year's income tax deduction for contributions made. Additionally, the company's employees support such local charitable causes as the Festival of Trees, The Boys & Girls Clubs of King County, Seattle Goodwill, Washington Autism Alliance & Advocacy, Food Lifeline, and more. FINALIST: Green Theory Photo by Rachel Coward\nBellevue's Green Theory opened in 2015 as the city's first recreational cannabis store. It does a lot more than just sell marijuana based products, though: The retailer has its heart in philanthropic efforts. Each October for the last three years, Green Theory has raised money to support cancer awareness and research with its Cannabis for a Cause program.

Soon, our inbox was flooded with people proclaiming their leader, charitable giving program, and innovations were tops. Now, after much deliberation, we are ready to reveal the best of the best in our five diverse categories celebrating all the Eastside has to offer. LEADER OF THE YEAR WINNER: Benson Porter, President and CEO of BECU Photo by Jeff Hobson\nIt makes sense that BECU , a company founded on the core idea of people helping people, is under the leadership of President and CEO Benson Porter \u2014 someone who has dedicated his life to serving communities and helping people.\nPorter grew up in the coastal town of Aberdeen, where he helped at the family business, Benson's Office Supply, throughout his high school years. It was there he developed an interest in community engagement, something he carried with him into his future endeavors.\nHe attended Whitman College and studied economics, and as he began to think about a future career realized that when it came to serving communities, he wanted to deal with the financial side of things. This combination led Porter into a successful career that included serving as president and CEO of First Tech Credit Union, and chief administrative officer for Washington Mutual. It was in 2012 that Porter took on his current position at BECU \u2014 a company that has been serving the Pacific Northwest since 1935.\nThough lauded for his leadership, Porter humbly credits the success of the institution to its employees and members.\n\"At BECU, giving back is in our DNA, and we're passionate about serving our local communities, including those on the Eastside. Providing our members with easy access to the tools and services they need to thrive and live financially healthy lives is one of our primary areas of focus and wouldn't be made possible without the hard work and dedication of all BECU employees and the support of our members,\" he said.\nPorter has more than 25 years of experience within the financial services industry and serves on multiple boards, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle/Des Moines, CO OP Financial Services, CU Direct, and Overseers of Whitman College. FINALIST: Char Patterson, Managing Principal of JPC Courtesy JPC Architects\nFor an example of a true leader, one who inspires everyone around her to work harder and smarter, look no further than Char Patterson, managing principal of JPC Architects. \"She is an incredible example of how a woman can be successful in a career that is often dominated by men and a wonderful resource for women that are aspiring to achieve her level of success,\" wrote nominator Melanie Pitsch, who serves as the human resources manager at JPC. Patterson has been performing commercial, residential, municipal, and industrial work with JPC since 1994 and has been a partner since 2006. During that time, Patterson has worked with such clients as Schnitzer Northwest, John L. Scott Real Estate, Cingular Wireless, Wyndham, and many more. FINALIST: Brent Frei, CEO of TerraClear Photo by Rachel Coward\nBrent Frei is more than a leader \u2014 he's an innovator. Frei currently is the mastermind behind TerraClear , a Bellevue based company that aims to map, identify, and remove rocks from farmland through the use of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, drones, and automation. Frei grew up in a small Idaho farming community, so he knows firsthand how backbreaking the rock picking process can be. After stepping away from Smartsheet, a Bellevue based online project management software company he helped found, Frei returned to his hometown and quickly realized there had to be a better way to perform the tedious, time consuming work of pulling rocks from the soil. Thus, he set out to put together a team and founded TerraClear in 2017.\nWINNER: Funko Photo by Jeff Hobson\nFor a company literally founded on fun \u2014 Funko founder Mike Becker has publicly stated that his company name stands for \"fun company\" \u2014 and rooted in pop culture, it comes as no surprise that the Everett based collectibles company has an office as funky and friendly as the iconic Pop! figures it creates.\nThe 88,000 square foot Wetmore Avenue fixture lures the denizens of Everett and beckons foreign and domestic travelers to its ground floor retail shop by presenting itself as a pop culture mecca. Inside, visitors are greeted by larger than life characters like a playful, wall climbing Spider Man and a menacing, imprisoned Joker. Fans can even take a selfie with Godzilla, hop in the Batmobile, or hang in Diagon Alley with \"The Boy Who Lived.\"\nAnd many other amazing, pop culture infused innovations are placed where no fan could go \u2014 the upstairs offices where 300 of Funko's more than 800 employees work.\n\"For innovation to flourish, it needs creativity, passion, and room to grow,\" Funko CEO Brian Mariotti said of the company's offices. \"All of these are alive and thriving in Everett.\"\nThere are Hanna Barbera themed conference rooms, jungle themed bathrooms (including a jungle soundtrack on loop), a photo and video studio, and a massive lounge on the second floor where employees can have lunch or chat with co workers.\nBut what really puts Funko over the top as an office space are the metal slides situated alongside each staircase on floors three, four, and five. Employees reminiscing of bygone carefree days on the playground can opt to zoom down the slide if they are running late for a meeting \u2014 or if they are just in need of an adrenaline rush.\nNeed more? The basement \u2014 or lower level \u2014 contains a modestly sized company gym and locker room, an arcade with classic cabinet games and pinball machines (all free, of course), and a lounge with plush purple couches and Hanna Barbera character portraits. But the real MVP of Funko's lower level is Funko Lanes, where several of the company's bowling teams maintain lively rivalries. FINALIST: Expedia Photo courtesy Expedia\nWe know Expedia is beginning its move across the lake, but we just can't get enough of the global travel company's current Bellevue office. Developed by the expert creatives at JPC Architects, Expedia's current home base was created with a global employee base in mind. \"To achieve this, JPC created distinct areas within the floor that support various traditional and nontraditional workstyles and can evolve with the company, culture, and future,\" JPC Marketing Manager Amanda Tallman wrote in her nomination. Notable attributes include huddle rooms, semi private collaboration booths, and library worktables, in addition to more traditional, yet beautiful, workstations and meeting rooms. Oh, and what's a travel company without a centrally located Tiki lounge where employees can quench a premeeting caffeine fix? Yeah, Expedia has got that, too. FINALIST: Inteum Photo courtesy Inteum\nMany of Inteum 's core employees have been with the Kirkland based software development company for more than a decade, and more still have crossed the five year threshold. What contributes to this longevity? Certainly, the company's innovative technology, accessibility, leadership, and loyal client base play a pivotal role. But we would be remiss if we didn't list Inteum's warm, bright office space as a factor, too. After all, it's all about location, location, location. Situated in a walkable neighborhood, the workspace gives employees their pick of nearby caf\u00e9s, pubs, and even a wood fired pizza kitchen. The office itself radiates warmth with its northwest facing windows overlooking Kirkland's Juanita Creek and glass office walls to allow as much natural light in as possible. And the option of a creekside patio can't be beat when compared to a stuffy conference room on a summer day. LEGACY BUSINESS OF THE YEAR WINNER: SanMar Coporation Photo by Jeff Hobson\nIn 1971, when Marty Lott started SanMar Corporation from his parents' Seattle basement, he didn't know he was creating a multigenerational legacy business. Nor did he realize that his T shirt company would grow into an apparel icon. But it has achieved both \u2014 and much more.\nSanMar, a blank garment and soft goods wholesale supplier, today employs more than 4,000 people and carries nearly two dozen retail, mill, and private label brands.\nAnd Lott still is an active leader in the company, along with sons, Jeremy and Jordan.\n\"We sell to people that either put a logo on shirts or resell it out,\" said Jeremy Lott, who serves as SanMar's president. \"If Microsoft is launching a product, they would buy those goods from one of our customers.\"\nAccording to Lott, the family came with an excellent role model. \"Grandpa was an entrepreneur,\" Marty Lott shared. \"He didn't have money and believed if it didn't work, he wasn't any worse off than he was when he started.\"\nMarty Lott indicated SanMar's goal is to, \"always be a leader, whether it be product, technology, or new services to the market,\" and also stated, \"SanMar's leadership isn't afraid to reinvent what the business is or what it's going to look like, and even though the business may change dramatically, the core values that have been the same for the last 50 years won't.\"\nSanMar's values were founded on kindness, Marty Lott explained, sharing it shows through in everything from the company's market presence to its people. \"We've attracted people who want to work in a company where others treat them nicely and there's a family atmosphere,\" he said.\nAccording to Marty Lott, SanMar's social responsibility program, Canvas for Good, was designed to spread kindness. \"We want to make an impact in the health and well being of the people that make our apparel products and positively impact the communities they live in,\" he said.\n\"It's not just about what we do, but also about our customers, and Canvas for Good is the way we tell those stories with a sense of community and pride,\" he concluded. \"A T shirt can do great things.\" FINALIST: Tripe XXX Drive In Photo by Triple XXX Root Beer\nTriple XXX Drive In 's roots stretch back to the first drive in restaurant in the Pacific Northwest in 1930, which sold Triple XXX Root Beer. In fact, the Issaquah Triple XXX is the only place you still can find the traditional XXX barrel the drink came from. The original restaurant was simply referred to as \"The Barrel\" by locals before moving in 1968 to its current location. While most Triple XXX restaurants eventually gave way to the trend of contemporary fast food outlets, this original Eastside business still thrives. FINALIST: Taco Time Northwest Photo courtesy Taco Time NW\nThe first Taco Time Northwest location opened in 1962, when Frank Tonkin Sr. became a pioneer in quick service Mexican restaurants. But the family's entrepreneurial roots in Renton date back more than 135 years, to when the current generation's great great great grandfather founded a small general store there. Today, cousins Chris and Robby Tonkin stand at the helm of their family's Taco Time Northwest legacy with 79 Western Washington restaurants \u2014 56 are family owned, while the remaining locations are franchised \u2014 and more than 2,000 employees. MOST INNOVATIVE WINNER: Quris Photo courtesy Tactuum\nIn a field where timely access to accurate information is a matter of life or death, Bellevue based Tactuum is transforming patient care at some of the country's top medical institutions.\nThe tech company's flagship product, Quris Clinical Companion, is a multifaceted, versatile platform that puts critical information at medical professionals' fingertips. The platform unlocks access to patient information and serves as a comprehensive reference guide, bringing the data that medical professionals need to one easily accessible location. Quris has been adopted by 44,000 medical professionals across the United States and is transforming approaches toward everything from emergency management to antimicrobial stewardship.\nTactuum was originally formed in 2012 by a team of healthcare and tech industry veterans, and one of its first projects was adopting a clinical book into an online format. Once published, clinical information quickly becomes obsolete, so the goal was to create a reference guide that could constantly be updated. Soon after, the company took on projects with University Medical Center New Orleans and the University of Washington.\nAs solutions director and cofounder Neil Francoeur explained, \"Since then, that's what our focus has been, getting information to the clinician in times of need.\"\nQuris' app and web platform, built in partnership with Microsoft, can be downloaded straight to clinicians' phones. The application streamlines and centralizes the information that medical practitioners need to implement the highest level of patient care. This has made Quris a critical tool for resident doctors and medical students. It also has been adopted by UW Medicine's Airlift Northwest program due to its offline capabilities, which get life saving information to physicians faster. Other popular uses of the app include critical care, emergency management, and helping practitioners determine the correct course of treatment for a patient.\nAccording to Francoeur, creating partnerships with cutting edge research institutions like the University of Washington has been key to innovating. \"When we started this adventure, I would have never thought we were going to be in helicopters,\" Francoeur said. But by tailoring the app to fit a variety of healthcare information needs, Tactuum has created an invaluable tool for medical professionals that is transforming patient outcomes across the country. FINALIST: Acumatica Photo courtesy Acumatica\nWhen it launched in 2008, Acumatica 's cloud based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software was considered a significant bet. \"It seems obvious now, but 11 plus years ago, there (were) still a lot of people running around saying this cloud thing isn't real,\" said CEO Jon Roskill. In the years since, the company has stayed true to its cutting edge roots; it was the first ERP system to do an Amazon Alexa integration and is rolling out innovations in AI and machine learning. But as Roskill explained, \"We're not just doing technical innovation. We're also innovating in the business side of software.\" The company recently released a Consumer Bill of Rights that challenges others in the industry to adopt its consumer friendly practices, such as unchanging End User License Agreements and usage based pricing. FINALIST: Essentia Water Photo courtesy Essentia Water\nEssentia Water 's CEO & founder Ken Uptain introduced alkaline water to the U.S. market when he launched the company in 1998. Most alkaline water brands wouldn't pop up until 10 years later, and as Uptain explained, Essentia Water's ionization process continues to set it apart. \"(Other companies) basically are putting minerals in the water to raise the pH but what we do is use technology and remove the acidic ions from the water and bottle more alkaline ions, which raise the pH. At the same time, we change the structure of the water, so it becomes more hydrating, more absorbing.\" One 2016 clinical trial showed Essentia Water hydrated 88 percent more effectively than the leading bottled water brand. MOST PHILANTHROPIC WINNER: Mox Boarding House Photo by Rodrigo DeMedeiros\nFor six years, a yearly gaming tournament like no other has been held where there's much more than a trophy at stake. In fact, the main purpose of Mox Boarding House 's Gauntlet gaming tournament is to raise money for local nonprofits.\nThis year, the mid May event raised $116,992 for an organization called El Centro de la Raza, which provides low income students throughout King County with mentors and tutors.\n\"I'm just really excited to see how people have embraced this event,\" said Lyla Ross, program manager for ENGAGE, Mox Boarding House's charitable giving arm that sponsors other charitable tournaments like The Chalice. Ross' husband co owns the company, and she is a former clinical social worker. \"I hoped it would be a fun thing and that our friends would want to be a part of it.

Prior to the competition beginning, 20 teams of four players are required to fundraise for six weeks within their communities. The more money they raise, Ross said, the more advantages they have in the tournament. For the sixth year in a row, Team Bungie (from the company of the same name) raised the most money \u2014 $70,000.\nOn the day of the tournament, which took place this year on May 19 at Mox's Bellevue location, teams played board games, circus trivia, and carnival games, round robin style.\nOrganizations that have benefited from the unique fundraiser include Wellspring Family Services, Treehouse, YouthCare, and Hopelink.

FINALIST: Acumatica Photo courtesy Acumatica\nWhen it launched in 2008, Acumatica 's cloud based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software was considered a significant bet. \"It seems obvious now, but 11 plus years ago, there (were) still a lot of people running around saying this cloud thing isn't real,\" said CEO Jon Roskill. In the years since, the company has stayed true to its cutting edge roots; it was the first ERP system to do an Amazon Alexa integration and is rolling out innovations in AI and machine learning. But as Roskill explained, \"We're not just doing technical innovation. We're also innovating in the business side of software.\" The company recently released a Consumer Bill of Rights that challenges others in the industry to adopt its consumer friendly practices, such as unchanging End User License Agreements and usage based pricing. FINALIST: Essentia Water Photo courtesy Essentia Water\nEssentia Water 's CEO & founder Ken Uptain introduced alkaline water to the U.S. market when he launched the company in 1998. Most alkaline water brands wouldn't pop up until 10 years later, and as Uptain explained, Essentia Water's ionization process continues to set it apart. \"(Other companies) basically are putting minerals in the water to raise the pH but what we do is use technology and remove the acidic ions from the water and bottle more alkaline ions, which raise the pH. At the same time, we change the structure of the water, so it becomes more hydrating, more absorbing.\" One 2016 clinical trial showed Essentia Water hydrated 88 percent more effectively than the leading bottled water brand. MOST PHILANTHROPIC WINNER: Mox Boarding House Photo by Rodrigo DeMedeiros\nFor six years, a yearly gaming tournament like no other has been held where there's much more than a trophy at stake. In fact, the main purpose of Mox Boarding House 's Gauntlet gaming tournament is to raise money for local nonprofits.\nThis year, the mid May event raised $116,992 for an organization called El Centro de la Raza, which provides low income students throughout King County with mentors and tutors.\n\"I'm just really excited to see how people have embraced this event,\" said Lyla Ross, program manager for ENGAGE, Mox Boarding House's charitable giving arm that sponsors other charitable tournaments like The Chalice. Ross' husband co owns the company, and she is a former clinical social worker. \"I hoped it would be a fun thing and that our friends would want to be a part of it. But it has really become a thing that people in our industry are interested in doing.\"\nThe event is organized by ENGAGE, the gaming company's community outreach committee, which Ross proposed back in 2012 and now manages part time. On top of the Gauntlet itself, the company sets a quarterly budget to donate games to local charitable organizations, provide meeting spaces for nonprofits, and organize donation drives.\nThe tournament itself, however, takes the cake for the most creative and exciting avenue for Mox Boarding House to give back. Prior to the competition beginning, 20 teams of four players are required to fundraise for six weeks within their communities. The more money they raise, Ross said, the more advantages they have in the tournament. For the sixth year in a row, Team Bungie (from the company of the same name) raised the most money \u2014 $70,000.\nOn the day of the tournament, which took place this year on May 19 at Mox's Bellevue location, teams played board games, circus trivia, and carnival games, round robin style.\nOrganizations that have benefited from the unique fundraiser include Wellspring Family Services, Treehouse, YouthCare, and Hopelink. ENGAGE has raised almost $695,000 in in six years. \u2014 ZB FINALIST: Merrill Lynch Photo by Jeff Hobson\nThe Bank of America Charitable Gift Fund helps customers maximize their giving to meaningful causes and offers specialized investment management through Merrill Lynch 's financial services division, or online with its self directed investing platform, Merrill Edge.

Additionally, the company's employees support such local charitable causes as the Festival of Trees, The Boys & Girls Clubs of King County, Seattle Goodwill, Washington Autism Alliance & Advocacy, Food Lifeline, and more. FINALIST: Green Theory Photo by Rachel Coward\nBellevue's Green Theory opened in 2015 as the city's first recreational cannabis store. It does a lot more than just sell marijuana based products, though: The retailer has its heart in philanthropic efforts.

Soon, our inbox was flooded with people proclaiming their leader, charitable giving program, and innovations were tops. Now, after much deliberation, we are ready to reveal the best of the best in our five diverse categories celebrating all the Eastside has to offer. LEADER OF THE YEAR WINNER: Benson Porter, President and CEO of BECU Photo by Jeff Hobson\nIt makes sense that BECU , a company founded on the core idea of people helping people, is under the leadership of President and CEO Benson Porter \u2014 someone who has dedicated his life to serving communities and helping people.\nPorter grew up in the coastal town of Aberdeen, where he helped at the family business, Benson's Office Supply, throughout his high school years. It was there he developed an interest in community engagement, something he carried with him into his future endeavors.\nHe attended Whitman College and studied economics, and as he began to think about a future career realized that when it came to serving communities, he wanted to deal with the financial side of things. This combination led Porter into a successful career that included serving as president and CEO of First Tech Credit Union, and chief administrative officer for Washington Mutual. It was in 2012 that Porter took on his current position at BECU \u2014 a company that has been serving the Pacific Northwest since 1935.\nThough lauded for his leadership, Porter humbly credits the success of the institution to its employees and members.\n\"At BECU, giving back is in our DNA, and we're passionate about serving our local communities, including those on the Eastside. Providing our members with easy access to the tools and services they need to thrive and live financially healthy lives is one of our primary areas of focus and wouldn't be made possible without the hard work and dedication of all BECU employees and the support of our members,\" he said.\nPorter has more than 25 years of experience within the financial services industry and serves on multiple boards, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle/Des Moines, CO OP Financial Services, CU Direct, and Overseers of Whitman College.

During that time, Patterson has worked with such clients as Schnitzer Northwest, John L. Scott Real Estate, Cingular Wireless, Wyndham, and many more. FINALIST: Brent Frei, CEO of TerraClear Photo by Rachel Coward\nBrent Frei is more than a leader \u2014 he's an innovator. Frei currently is the mastermind behind TerraClear , a Bellevue based company that aims to map, identify, and remove rocks from farmland through the use of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, drones, and automation. Frei grew up in a small Idaho farming community, so he knows firsthand how backbreaking the rock picking process can be. After stepping away from Smartsheet, a Bellevue based online project management software company he helped found, Frei returned to his hometown and quickly realized there had to be a better way to perform the tedious, time consuming work of pulling rocks from the soil. Thus, he set out to put together a team and founded TerraClear in 2017.\nWINNER: Funko Photo by Jeff Hobson\nFor a company literally founded on fun \u2014 Funko founder Mike Becker has publicly stated that his company name stands for \"fun company\" \u2014 and rooted in pop culture, it comes as no surprise that the Everett based collectibles company has an office as funky and friendly as the iconic Pop! figures it creates.\nThe 88,000 square foot Wetmore Avenue fixture lures the denizens of Everett and beckons foreign and domestic travelers to its ground floor retail shop by presenting itself as a pop culture mecca. Inside, visitors are greeted by larger than life characters like a playful, wall climbing Spider Man and a menacing, imprisoned Joker. Fans can even take a selfie with Godzilla, hop in the Batmobile, or hang in Diagon Alley with \"The Boy Who Lived.\"\nAnd many other amazing, pop culture infused innovations are placed where no fan could go \u2014 the upstairs offices where 300 of Funko's more than 800 employees work.\n\"For innovation to flourish, it needs creativity, passion, and room to grow,\" Funko CEO Brian Mariotti said of the company's offices. \"All of these are alive and thriving in Everett.\"\nThere are Hanna Barbera themed conference rooms, jungle themed bathrooms (including a jungle soundtrack on loop), a photo and video studio, and a massive lounge on the second floor where employees can have lunch or chat with co workers.\nBut what really puts Funko over the top as an office space are the metal slides situated alongside each staircase on floors three, four, and five. Employees reminiscing of bygone carefree days on the playground can opt to zoom down the slide if they are running late for a meeting \u2014 or if they are just in need of an adrenaline rush.\nNeed more? The basement \u2014 or lower level \u2014 contains a modestly sized company gym and locker room, an arcade with classic cabinet games and pinball machines (all free, of course), and a lounge with plush purple couches and Hanna Barbera character portraits. But the real MVP of Funko's lower level is Funko Lanes, where several of the company's bowling teams maintain lively rivalries. FINALIST: Expedia Photo courtesy Expedia\nWe know Expedia is beginning its move across the lake, but we just can't get enough of the global travel company's current Bellevue office. Developed by the expert creatives at JPC Architects, Expedia's current home base was created with a global employee base in mind. \"To achieve this, JPC created distinct areas within the floor that support various traditional and nontraditional workstyles and can evolve with the company, culture, and future,\" JPC Marketing Manager Amanda Tallman wrote in her nomination. Notable attributes include huddle rooms, semi private collaboration booths, and library worktables, in addition to more traditional, yet beautiful, workstations and meeting rooms. Oh, and what's a travel company without a centrally located Tiki lounge where employees can quench a premeeting caffeine fix? Yeah, Expedia has got that, too. FINALIST: Inteum Photo courtesy Inteum\nMany of Inteum 's core employees have been with the Kirkland based software development company for more than a decade, and more still have crossed the five year threshold. What contributes to this longevity? Certainly, the company's innovative technology, accessibility, leadership, and loyal client base play a pivotal role. But we would be remiss if we didn't list Inteum's warm, bright office space as a factor, too. After all, it's all about location, location, location. Situated in a walkable neighborhood, the workspace gives employees their pick of nearby caf\u00e9s, pubs, and even a wood fired pizza kitchen. The office itself radiates warmth with its northwest facing windows overlooking Kirkland's Juanita Creek and glass office walls to allow as much natural light in as possible. And the option of a creekside patio can't be beat when compared to a stuffy conference room on a summer day. LEGACY BUSINESS OF THE YEAR WINNER: SanMar Coporation Photo by Jeff Hobson\nIn 1971, when Marty Lott started SanMar Corporation from his parents' Seattle basement, he didn't know he was creating a multigenerational legacy business. Nor did he realize that his T shirt company would grow into an apparel icon. But it has achieved both \u2014 and much more.\nSanMar, a blank garment and soft goods wholesale supplier, today employs more than 4,000 people and carries nearly two dozen retail, mill, and private label brands.\nAnd Lott still is an active leader in the company, along with sons, Jeremy and Jordan.\n\"We sell to people that either put a logo on shirts or resell it out,\" said Jeremy Lott, who serves as SanMar's president. \"If Microsoft is launching a product, they would buy those goods from one of our customers.\"\nAccording to Lott, the family came with an excellent role model. \"Grandpa was an entrepreneur,\" Marty Lott shared. \"He didn't have money and believed if it didn't work, he wasn't any worse off than he was when he started.\"\nMarty Lott indicated SanMar's goal is to, \"always be a leader, whether it be product, technology, or new services to the market,\" and also stated, \"SanMar's leadership isn't afraid to reinvent what the business is or what it's going to look like, and even though the business may change dramatically, the core values that have been the same for the last 50 years won't.\"\nSanMar's values were founded on kindness, Marty Lott explained, sharing it shows through in everything from the company's market presence to its people. \"We've attracted people who want to work in a company where others treat them nicely and there's a family atmosphere,\" he said.\nAccording to Marty Lott, SanMar's social responsibility program, Canvas for Good, was designed to spread kindness. \"We want to make an impact in the health and well being of the people that make our apparel products and positively impact the communities they live in,\" he said.\n\"It's not just about what we do, but also about our customers, and Canvas for Good is the way we tell those stories with a sense of community and pride,\" he concluded. \"A T shirt can do great things.\" FINALIST: Tripe XXX Drive In Photo by Triple XXX Root Beer\nTriple XXX Drive In 's roots stretch back to the first drive in restaurant in the Pacific Northwest in 1930, which sold Triple XXX Root Beer. In fact, the Issaquah Triple XXX is the only place you still can find the traditional XXX barrel the drink came from. The original restaurant was simply referred to as \"The Barrel\" by locals before moving in 1968 to its current location. While most Triple XXX restaurants eventually gave way to the trend of contemporary fast food outlets, this original Eastside business still thrives. FINALIST: Taco Time Northwest Photo courtesy Taco Time NW\nThe first Taco Time Northwest location opened in 1962, when Frank Tonkin Sr. became a pioneer in quick service Mexican restaurants. But the family's entrepreneurial roots in Renton date back more than 135 years, to when the current generation's great great great grandfather founded a small general store there. Today, cousins Chris and Robby Tonkin stand at the helm of their family's Taco Time Northwest legacy with 79 Western Washington restaurants \u2014 56 are family owned, while the remaining locations are franchised \u2014 and more than 2,000 employees. MOST INNOVATIVE WINNER: Quris Photo courtesy Tactuum\nIn a field where timely access to accurate information is a matter of life or death, Bellevue based Tactuum is transforming patient care at some of the country's top medical institutions.\nThe tech company's flagship product, Quris Clinical Companion, is a multifaceted, versatile platform that puts critical information at medical professionals' fingertips. The platform unlocks access to patient information and serves as a comprehensive reference guide, bringing the data that medical professionals need to one easily accessible location. Quris has been adopted by 44,000 medical professionals across the United States and is transforming approaches toward everything from emergency management to antimicrobial stewardship.\nTactuum was originally formed in 2012 by a team of healthcare and tech industry veterans, and one of its first projects was adopting a clinical book into an online format. Once published, clinical information quickly becomes obsolete, so the goal was to create a reference guide that could constantly be updated. Soon after, the company took on projects with University Medical Center New Orleans and the University of Washington.\nAs solutions director and cofounder Neil Francoeur explained, \"Since then, that's what our focus has been, getting information to the clinician in times of need.\"\nQuris' app and web platform, built in partnership with Microsoft, can be downloaded straight to clinicians' phones. The application streamlines and centralizes the information that medical practitioners need to implement the highest level of patient care. This has made Quris a critical tool for resident doctors and medical students. It also has been adopted by UW Medicine's Airlift Northwest program due to its offline capabilities, which get life saving information to physicians faster. Other popular uses of the app include critical care, emergency management, and helping practitioners determine the correct course of treatment for a patient.\nAccording to Francoeur, creating partnerships with cutting edge research institutions like the University of Washington has been key to innovating. \"When we started this adventure, I would have never thought we were going to be in helicopters,\" Francoeur said. But by tailoring the app to fit a variety of healthcare information needs, Tactuum has created an invaluable tool for medical professionals that is transforming patient outcomes across the country.

Quris has been adopted by 44,000 medical professionals across the United States and is transforming approaches toward everything from emergency management to antimicrobial stewardship.\nTactuum was originally formed in 2012 by a team of healthcare and tech industry veterans, and one of its first projects was adopting a clinical book into an online format. Once published, clinical information quickly becomes obsolete, so the goal was to create a reference guide that could constantly be updated. Soon after, the company took on projects with University Medical Center New Orleans and the University of Washington.\nAs solutions director and cofounder Neil Francoeur explained, \"Since then, that's what our focus has been, getting information to the clinician in times of need.\"\nQuris' app and web platform, built in partnership with Microsoft, can be downloaded straight to clinicians' phones. The application streamlines and centralizes the information that medical practitioners need to implement the highest level of patient care. This has made Quris a critical tool for resident doctors and medical students. It also has been adopted by UW Medicine's Airlift Northwest program due to its offline capabilities, which get life saving information to physicians faster. Other popular uses of the app include critical care, emergency management, and helping practitioners determine the correct course of treatment for a patient.\nAccording to Francoeur, creating partnerships with cutting edge research institutions like the University of Washington has been key to innovating. \"When we started this adventure, I would have never thought we were going to be in helicopters,\" Francoeur said. But by tailoring the app to fit a variety of healthcare information needs, Tactuum has created an invaluable tool for medical professionals that is transforming patient outcomes across the country. FINALIST: Acumatica Photo courtesy Acumatica\nWhen it launched in 2008, Acumatica 's cloud based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software was considered a significant bet. \"It seems obvious now, but 11 plus years ago, there (were) still a lot of people running around saying this cloud thing isn't real,\" said CEO Jon Roskill. In the years since, the company has stayed true to its cutting edge roots; it was the first ERP system to do an Amazon Alexa integration and is rolling out innovations in AI and machine learning. But as Roskill explained, \"We're not just doing technical innovation. We're also innovating in the business side of software.\" The company recently released a Consumer Bill of Rights that challenges others in the industry to adopt its consumer friendly practices, such as unchanging End User License Agreements and usage based pricing. FINALIST: Essentia Water Photo courtesy Essentia Water\nEssentia Water 's CEO & founder Ken Uptain introduced alkaline water to the U.S. market when he launched the company in 1998. Most alkaline water brands wouldn't pop up until 10 years later, and as Uptain explained, Essentia Water's ionization process continues to set it apart. \"(Other companies) basically are putting minerals in the water to raise the pH but what we do is use technology and remove the acidic ions from the water and bottle more alkaline ions, which raise the pH. At the same time, we change the structure of the water, so it becomes more hydrating, more absorbing.\" One 2016 clinical trial showed Essentia Water hydrated 88 percent more effectively than the leading bottled water brand. MOST PHILANTHROPIC WINNER: Mox Boarding House Photo by Rodrigo DeMedeiros\nFor six years, a yearly gaming tournament like no other has been held where there's much more than a trophy at stake. In fact, the main purpose of Mox Boarding House 's Gauntlet gaming tournament is to raise money for local nonprofits.\nThis year, the mid May event raised $116,992 for an organization called El Centro de la Raza, which provides low income students throughout King County with mentors and tutors.\n\"I'm just really excited to see how people have embraced this event,\" said Lyla Ross, program manager for ENGAGE, Mox Boarding House's charitable giving arm that sponsors other charitable tournaments like The Chalice. Ross' husband co owns the company, and she is a former clinical social worker. \"I hoped it would be a fun thing and that our friends would want to be a part of it. But it has really become a thing that people in our industry are interested in doing.\"\nThe event is organized by ENGAGE, the gaming company's community outreach committee, which Ross proposed back in 2012 and now manages part time. On top of the Gauntlet itself, the company sets a quarterly budget to donate games to local charitable organizations, provide meeting spaces for nonprofits, and organize donation drives.\nThe tournament itself, however, takes the cake for the most creative and exciting avenue for Mox Boarding House to give back. Prior to the competition beginning, 20 teams of four players are required to fundraise for six weeks within their communities. The more money they raise, Ross said, the more advantages they have in the tournament. For the sixth year in a row, Team Bungie (from the company of the same name) raised the most money \u2014 $70,000.\nOn the day of the tournament, which took place this year on May 19 at Mox's Bellevue location, teams played board games, circus trivia, and carnival games, round robin style.\nOrganizations that have benefited from the unique fundraiser include Wellspring Family Services, Treehouse, YouthCare, and Hopelink. ENGAGE has raised almost $695,000 in in six years. \u2014 ZB FINALIST: Merrill Lynch Photo by Jeff Hobson\nThe Bank of America Charitable Gift Fund helps customers maximize their giving to meaningful causes and offers specialized investment management through Merrill Lynch 's financial services division, or online with its self directed investing platform, Merrill Edge. The fund strategizes charitable giving and keeps track of each year's income tax deduction for contributions made. Additionally, the company's employees support such local charitable causes as the Festival of Trees, The Boys & Girls Clubs of King County, Seattle Goodwill, Washington Autism Alliance & Advocacy, Food Lifeline, and more. FINALIST: Green Theory Photo by Rachel Coward\nBellevue's Green Theory opened in 2015 as the city's first recreational cannabis store. It does a lot more than just sell marijuana based products, though: The retailer has its heart in philanthropic efforts. Each October for the last three years, Green Theory has raised money to support cancer awareness and research with its Cannabis for a Cause program. Beneficiaries of donations from this event and from other year round giving include Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Bellevue LifeSpring, Motley Zoo Animal Rescue, and Northwest Harvest.", "URL": "https://425business.com/2019-idea-awards/"}]}, {"client": "CENTRICA PLC | GB001H1Q", "industry": "Energy & Utilities", "segment": "Industry", "intensity": 55.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "SCOTTISH & SOUTHERN ENERGY | GB001H23", "industry": "Energy & Utilities", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 66.0, "market": "UKI", "products": "Microsoft Azure", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "ALLSTATE INSURANCE CORP | GB001HR5", "industry": "Computer Services", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 8.0, "market": "UKI", "products": "Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "ALLSTATE INSURANCE CORP | GB001HR5", "industry": "Insurance", "segment": "Industry", "intensity": 321.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft System Center OpsMgr, Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Strong", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "AMERICAN NATIONAL INSURANCE | GB001HRG", "industry": "Insurance", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 9.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "DAVIS+HENDERSON | GB001HRR", "industry": "Wholesale Distribution & Services", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 36.0, "market": "Canada", "products": "Microsoft Azure", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "THE TRAVELERS INDEMNITY COMPANY | GB001HUZ", "industry": "Insurance", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 52.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION | GB001HV2", "industry": "Media & Entertainment", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 25.0, "market": "UKI", "products": "Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE | GB001HXV", "industry": "Financial Markets", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 8.0, "market": "UKI", "products": "Microsoft System Center OpsMgr, Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "MARATHON OIL CO | GB001J1C", "industry": "Chemicals & Petroleum", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 71.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "CAPITA PLC | GB001J1Y", "industry": "Computer Services", "segment": "Commercial", "intensity": 15.0, "market": "UKI", "products": "Microsoft Azure", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "BUPA LTD | GB001J4G", "industry": "Healthcare", "segment": "Commercial", "intensity": 197.0, "market": "Australia/NZ", "products": "Microsoft Azure", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Neutral", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "BUPA LTD | GB001J4G", "industry": "Healthcare", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 33.0, "market": "UKI", "products": "Microsoft Azure", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "TOURISTIK UNION INTERNATIONA | GB001J5K", "industry": "Travel & Transportation", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 12.0, "market": "DACH", "products": "Microsoft System Center", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "HILL-ROM HOLDINGS INC | GB001J6H", "industry": "Electronics", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 70.0, "market": "US", "products": "Microsoft Azure", "score": 8.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": [{"Title": "Hill-Rom Expands Digital Health Capabilities In New Global Collaboration With Microsoft | FirstWord MedTech", "Text": "CHICAGO, Jan. 8, 2019 /PRNewswire/ Hill Rom (NYSE: HRC ), a global medical technology company, announced today a collaboration with Microsoft to bring advanced, actionable point of care data and solutions to caregivers and healthcare provider organizations.\nThe combined offerings, using Microsoft Azure\u00ae, are intended to dynamically analyze real time sensing data from medical devices and historical medical record information, and communicate potential patient risk and hospital protocol actions directly to caregivers at the point of care.

During that time, the volume and complexity of monitoring data being produced and consumed increased by 10x year on year. This growth was driven by the movement from a few monolithic applications to thousands of microservices as well as the migration from hundreds of servers to millions of containers. It quickly became obvious that neither the open source solutions Mao and Skillington were using at the time, nor commercially available solutions, could sustain the level of scale, performance and cost required by the team. The only course of action they saw was to build a new solution M3 which they developed in open source from day one for the benefit of the community at large. Over the course of four years, Mao and Skillington led the team that scaled M3 to one of the largest production metrics systems in the world, storing tens of billions of time series while both ingesting and querying billions of datapoints per second. This provided Uber with comprehensive insight into its infrastructure and applications for engineers and real time visibility of the overall business for operations teams.\n\"We started by writing an open source streaming metrics aggregator and distributed time series database that would scale with the business and operate with zero downtime when availability zones experienced failures,\" said Skillington. \"At Chronosphere, the team is focused on providing something that companies can start using within minutes, while we continue to develop and maintain M3 as open source.\"\nAfter recognizing that other high growth companies struggled with the same challenges as they moved to a cloud native architecture, Mao and Skillington went on to found Chronosphere so they could bring the benefits of M3 to enterprises everywhere while continuing to support the open source community which comprises 7 of the Fortune 200 including Comcast and FedEx.\nThe first Chronosphere product is a hosted end to end monitoring platform which is built on top of M3. Chronosphere's platform adds enterprise features such as intelligent rate limiting, resource management and security and access controls such that all teams within an organization can leverage the power of a single centralized platform. Chronosphere also provides visualization and alerting capabilities that are designed to provide for sane operability at scale given the volume of underlying data. The platform also helps auto categorize the data and extracts higher level meaning for deeper insights.\nToday Chronosphere also announced $11 million in Series A funding led by Greylock with participation from Lux Capital.\n\"For enterprises, there is a huge unmet need for high dimensionality (HD) metrics at scale with global reliability and low cost,\" said Jerry Chen, partner at Greylock. \"Chronosphere enables enterprises to run their business at a resolution that isn't available from existing open source and commercial offerings. It's like using a 4K monitor to run your business: once you use HD you can't go back to VGA.\" The Latest AIOps for Networking the Dawning of a New Era November 05, 2019\n change.

How does a WAN cloud exchange work? WAN cloud exchanges provide private and secure connectivity to cloud environments, making them beneficial for software defined WAN and SaaS platforms. John Burke Nemertes Research\nA WAN cloud exchange or just cloud exchange enables enterprises to connect with cloud service providers without sending traffic solely over the internet.\nEnterprises usually connect to a WAN cloud exchange using a dedicated physical connection in a meet me facility, such as a data center hosting site. The exchange provider connects the exchange's network directly to a variety of cloud providers' networks.\nEnterprises spin up virtual circuits with the exchange to connect to cloud providers' networks. They still have to buy the right to do so, however; for example, they may buy the right to set up an Azure ExpressRoute from Microsoft or a Direct Connect gateway from AWS.\nWAN cloud exchanges provide more secure connections and more consistent performance, which reduce business and operational risk. Cloud exchanges work well with software defined WAN technology, which uses them as another available path to a cloud destination and routes traffic through them according to defined security and performance policies. WAN cloud exchange providers\nWAN cloud exchange providers include most telecoms companies, such as AT&T and Comcast; network as a service providers, such as Aryaka; and most large data center hosting providers, such as Equinix. Many enterprises have multiple options available from their current partner list, and they should always include those partners in their evaluations.

The two technology giants announced a multi year alliance, focused on cloud, AI, 5G, and edge computing.\nThe AT&T Microsoft partnership has AT&T agreeing to migrate much of its non network infrastructure applications to the Microsoft Azure cloud. AT&T will also equip much of its workforce with the cloud based Microsoft 365 office and collaboration suite.\nThis looks to be a big win for the Microsoft cloud business line, and probably at the expense of Amazon AWS and Google cloud rivals.\nThe partnership will also have Microsoft tap AT&T technologies, including 5G, to build edge computing capabilities and applications. The two companies plan to work together to bring integrated technology applications to market, including voice, collaboration and conferencing, intelligent edge and networking, IoT, public safety, and cybersecurity, a press release states.\n\"AT&T is at the forefront of defining how advances in technology, including 5G and edge computing, will transform every aspect of work and life,\" said Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft in a prepared statement. \"Together, we will apply the power of Azure and Microsoft 365 to transform the way AT&T's workforce collaborates and to shape the future of media and communications for people everywhere.\"\nAT&T Microsoft Partnership The two companies point to a collaborative effort on an edge computing based effort for tracking and detecting drones as an example of the type of applications that could emerge from this deal. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella with AT&T Communications CEO John Donovan (Source: AT&T)\nAnother potential example includes a scenario where a 5G equipped first responder uses AI powered live voice translation to communicate with someone in need who speaks a different language.\n\"AT&T and Microsoft are among the most committed companies to fostering technology that serves people,\" said John Donovan, CEO, AT&T Communications in a prepared statement. \"By working together on common efforts around 5G, the cloud, and AI, we will accelerate the speed of innovation and impact for our customers and our communities.\"\nThe AT&T Microsoft partnership appears to be broader than the just announced AT&T IBM deal. That deal is cloud focused as well but is limited to the AT&T Business Solutions business unit, helping to better manage internal applications. A key objective of the IBM deal is to provide tools for AT&T Business solutions to better serve enterprise customers. Did you like this post?

AT&T gets a direct connection to a public cloud giant that can deploy and host services closer to customers, thereby lowering latency. Similarly, Microsoft will shorten the distance between its data centres and end users; it won't have to deliver them to AT&T's network via the Internet. Customers are the ultimate beneficiaries, of course; this is all good news for stuff like AR/VR, and remote controlled machines like drones and cars.\nIn the longer term, AT&T could potentially be in a position to host Microsoft services on its own infrastructure, despite having already sold off its data centres. Philip Laidler, partner and consulting director at STL Partners, explained recently to TelecomTV that as telcos virtualise and distribute more network functions, they could be in a position to host services from the likes of Microsoft in the same facilities that host these virtualised networks. Sure, some telcos might host their entire virtualised networks in third party data centres, but most might prefer to maintain some of their own facilities.\n\"Operators are building small data centres to support their virtualised networks and therefore they essentially are going to have an environment that they can use to offer edge compute, whether it's the complete stack, or some of the stack, or if it's NFVi, or it's entirely separate physical infrastructure that just sits alongside it in a different cabinet,\" Laidler said.\nIn this context, the AT&T Microsoft deal isn't just about AT&T making up for its lack of in house cloud expertise or infrastructure (although more on that later). There are benefits here for Microsoft that could prove vital to its rivalry with Amazon and Google.\nThere are also mutual benefits here when it comes to navigating the sheer complexity of distributed cloud and edge computing. It's not just about 5G. There will be services deployed at the edge that will want to reach the end user over Wi Fi, NB IoT, LTE M, fibre, LoRaWAN and so on. Different services will make different demands on the network. Through collaboration, the industry stands a better chance of making it all work.\nOf course, you can't spend ages negotiating a big partnership just to sum it all up like that. No, you have to tick off buzzwords like AI, and hammer home the point about how great this is for 5G. It's all relevant, of course, but it somewhat clouds (geddit?) the more important issues. Extra tuition\nAn equally interesting strand to this partnership relates to tooling up and skilling up. It couldn't be more obvious from AT&T's announcement \u2013 and the partnership announced earlier this week with IBM \u2013 that the telco is following through with its major commitment to cloud.\nUnder its 'public cloud first' strategy, AT&T plans to shift most of its non network workloads to the public cloud by 2024. Its partnership with Microsoft will see AT&T equip staff with Microsoft 365, and migrate non network infrastructure applications to Azure.\nWhat has become obvious then, is that while once upon a time, AT&T's major commitment to cloud would have involved capex, and building or acquiring data centres, now it necessitates broad and deep partnerships with experts in the field, highlighting how telcos \u2013 even giants like AT&T \u2013 have missed their window for becoming the experts themselves.\nAs Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella put it: \"The world's leading companies run on our cloud, and we are delighted that AT&T chose Microsoft to accelerate its innovation. Together, we will apply the power of Azure and Microsoft 365 to transform the way AT&T's workforce collaborates and to shape the future of media and communications for people everywhere.\" Related Topics", "URL": "https://www.telecomtv.com/content/edge/at-t-microsoft-sharpen-their-edge-with-mega-partnership-35814/"}, {"Title": "Windows Server 2008 End of Life & Microsoft Helps Nunavut Recover: FoxNet IT Round Up", "Text": "Microsoft Steps in to Help Nunavut Deal with Ransomware Fallout The Nunavut government experienced a ransomware attack in early November which affected their public services department.

Finance | heraldchronicle.com", "Text": "CHICAGO (BUSINESS WIRE) Sep 24, 2019 \nMicrosoft and ENGIE today announced both a long term solar and wind energy power purchase agreement (PPA) that provides 24/7 supply in the United States and implementation of Darwin, energy software developed by ENGIE using the intelligent cloud services of Microsoft Azure to optimize performance of ENGIE's wind, solar, and hybrid (wind + solar) renewable assets worldwide.\nThe renewable deal will see Microsoft purchase a total of 230 MW from two ENGIE projects in Texas, bringing Microsoft's renewable energy portfolio to more than 1,900 MW. Microsoft will purchase the majority of the output from the new 200 MW Las Lomas wind project, which will be located in Starr & Zapata Counties in south Texas. Microsoft will also purchase 85 MW from the 200 MW Anson Solar Center project, which will be built in Jones County in central Texas. Both projects will be operated by ENGIE and are expected to come on line in January 2021.\n\"ENGIE's ambition is to work with our customers and communities to lead the transition to a zero carbon world,\" said Gwena\u00eblle Avice Huet, President and CEO, ENGIE North America and Executive Vice President in charge of ENGIE's Global Renewable Business Line. \"We are proud to support Microsoft in its plan to increasingly meet its energy needs with renewable power, and to do so in a highly customized way to meet 24/7 demand over many years.\"\nThe relationship between ENGIE and Microsoft will not only add more clean energy to the grid in the United States, it also creates an example for how customers can procure it. This PPA includes an innovative volume firming agreement (VFA) that will convert the intermittent renewable energy supply into a fixed 24/7 power solution aligned with Microsoft's energy needs.\nIn addition, ENGIE and Microsoft are advancing the digital transformation of the renewable energy sector. ENGIE's Darwin software, currently deployed on more than 15,000 MW of assets globally, enables real time plant monitoring and control, reporting, forecasting, performance monitoring, and predictive maintenance, among many other benefits. Darwin relies on the latest Microsoft Azure cloud, AI and IoT services. Darwin has already enabled ENGIE to increase plant availability and to enhance production performance of up to a few percent on some of its assets.\nWith renewable energy expected to be the largest single source of electricity growth in the next five years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), these kinds of data driven solutions will become increasingly important. ENGIE alone has a program to build approximately 9,000 MW of new renewable energy projects from 2019 2021 globally, with 2,500 MW of new renewable capacity planned for North America. The company has an additional 10,000 MW of wind and solar projects in its broader development pipeline in the U.S. and Canada.\n\"Procuring more renewable energy helps to transform our operations, but when we pair that with Microsoft's leading cloud and AI tools, we can transform the world,\" said Brian Janous, General Manager of Energy and Sustainability at Microsoft. \"This agreement with ENGIE is an exciting step towards a low carbon future, driven by capital investments and enabled by data.\"\nAbout ENGIE North America\nENGIE North America Inc. offers a range of capabilities in the United States and Canada to help customers decarbonize, decentralize, and digitalize their operations. These include comprehensive services to help customers run their facilities more efficiently and optimize energy and other resource use and expense; clean power generation; energy storage; and retail energy supply that includes renewable, demand response, and on bill financing options. Nearly 100% of the company's power generation portfolio is low carbon or renewable.

The suite of enterprise platforms will deliver customised technology solutions to drive modern digital interactions. The company's industry experts will develop and enhance its platforms, creating new, updated sets of cloud based enterprise technology, powered by Microsoft Azure. Conduent will integrate Microsoft Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS), Azure Blockchain Workbench, Azure Cognitive Services and Azure Machine Learning service (AzureML) throughout its client portfolio, delivering them on Azure. \"Microsoft Azure promotes our mission of elevating every interaction by automating and increasing the reliability of routine tasks,\" said Rahul Gupta, Chief Technology and Product Officer, Conduent. \"This strategic alignment expands Conduent's platform options to provide seamless enterprise cloud solutions running on Azure.\" Jean Philippe Courtois, President and EVP, Microsoft Global Sales, Marketing and Operations, Microsoft Corp. said, \" Our latest collaboration with Conduent combines their intelligent digital experiences solutions with the power of Microsoft Azure. Together with Conduent, we will deliver technology solutions using blockchain and virtual agents across their five new enterprise platforms, all run on our scalable cloud. I look forward to seeing how this relationship empowers Conduent to drive customised digital interactions for all of its clients.\" At a soon to be established Conduent Centre of Excellence in Hyderabad, India, and at Conduent's Technology and Innovation Hub in Raleigh, North Carolina in the United States, Conduent will continue to integrate Azure into Conduent platforms. Platforms and Pilot Ready Solutions Conduent is making significant investments \u2013 including $200 million for platform modernisation through 2020 \u2013 to become a key partner that helps its clients accelerate their digital journeys. Across all of Conduent's 80 plus offerings, this core technology and innovation foundation will underpin all existing solutions to drive enhanced digital interactions. This same platform will be used to build future solutions and offerings for our industries and horizontals. The suite of platforms helps Conduent and its clients configure solutions faster, thanks to common modules and drag and drop capabilities for a smoother design process, while improving clients' usability with a consistent look and feel. Of the five new enterprise platforms, two have pilot ready applications in place. The new suite of platforms include:\nDara \u2013 Conduent's AI Conversation Platform: a virtual agent platform that assists in the completion of routine tasks through voice, webchat, SMS and other digital interaction methods, resulting in a better, more personalised customer experience. Cognitive, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are used to help Dara have conversations in an automated, conversational manner. If Dara doesn't have the answer, she automatically routes the customer to a human agent. She continuously learns from humans to improve the quality of customer service answers over time. Dara works with Amazon Alexa, Google Home and other voice channels. Need to Pay Your Tolling Bill? Just Ask Dara: Conduent is piloting Dara with an electronic tolling provider to deliver 24/7 customer service through multiple communication channels. Transportation customers can use the assistant to check their balance, add account details, order a transponder and make payments. Using Microsoft LUIS, the chatbot will offer end users interacting with Conduent transportation systems a point of contact, enabling automated, personalised service through webchat, SMS, Microsoft Cortana, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\nConduent Analytics Platform: supports intelligence and analytics capabilities to improve business outcomes. It harnesses structured and unstructured data from multiple sources, and extracts and integrates descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analytics. The information and insights help businesses make smarter, efficient and intelligent decisions. Predicting Telco Churn: To help telecommunications clients retain their customers, Conduent's Loyalty Analyzer solution sifts through data such as customer service interactions, billing inquiries, usage characteristics and competitor offers to model loyalty behaviour and determine the most critical factors contributing to customers leaving a service.

becoming like air and water. Businesses need them to survive.\nThat basic point was driven home recently for Brian Pagano , senior director of Catalysts at Axway Inc., which provides cloud integration and API and identity management software. and former global platform strategist at Google LLC. He recently spoke with a major customer who made it clear that if the firm's API management system went down, the company would be out of business.\n\"That API is their 'open for business' sign,\" Pagano said. \"In the next several years, the only companies that are going to survive are those that are API first.\"\nIndeed, some of the world's most valuable companies, including newly public firms such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc., were built largely on APIs to other services. Getting value from data\nPagano spoke at the APIdays 2019 conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. He made a case that success for most companies will depend on building platforms and mining data driven insights using artificial intelligence and machine learning, all enabled by APIs.\n\"The answer to the question of who's going to win the next round is who is getting the most value from their data,\" Pagano said.\nTo underscore how entrenched APIs have become in the enterprise, eBay Inc. embarked on a journey several years ago to modernize its API suite. The firm now has 23 families of APIs on its platform to support 1.2 billion live listings, according to Gail Frederick (pictured), vice president of mobile and developer ecosystem at eBay.\nThe result is that if APIs suddenly disappeared from eBay's massive e commerce engine, the impact would not be good for the economic health of the company.\n\"Our APIs bring in about $19 billion of gross merchandise sold on our platform every year,\" Frederick said during a presentation at the conference. \"They drive our business.\" Banking as a service\nAPIs are also beginning to play an important role in powering key drivers of the global economy such as the banking industry. BBVA has created an open API marketplace on its website for financial technology companies interested in implementing banking related solutions.\nAPIs for card purchase data, payments and business account documentation are already available. It's all part of banking as a service or BaaS, which is beginning to ripple through both traditional banking and fintech in much the same way that Amazon Web Services Inc.'s packaged services transformed cloud computing. Photo: Mark Albertson\n\"Banking as a service is bringing banking its AWS moment,\" Susan French , head of product at BBVA Open Platform, said Tuesday, describing how the bank's API platform was extending its business into the fintech startup world. \"The network effect enables us to create relationships with customers we would not usually have.\"\nBy making APIs available to developers on its platform, BBVA hopes to generate additional new services for its customers. French is hopeful that will soon facilitate faster payments and seamless integration of third party risk services for user authentication and fraud management.\n\"Developer as customer is just as important as consumer as customer,\" French said. Coherence fuels API economy\nThe experiences of both eBay and BBVA highlight an important trend in the evolving API story. This is not about starting whole new technologies from scratch. It's about using tools to build on services that were already there to begin with and reaping a much greater return for the time and work invested. This is also transforming enterprises internally as well as externally.\n\"We love tools, we love to build things,\" said Uri Sarid , chief technology officer at MuleSoft LLC. \"That combination of leverage and return on investment is what's really fueling this API economy. This is fueling a revolution inside of companies as much as outside of companies.\"\nThat revolution is part of what Sarid characterizes as the \"coherence economy,\" where in areas such as travel, human needs are automatically aligned across an ecosystem of services and products. Planning a trip? Let APIs provide dining, lodging, transportation and entertainment in one seamless experience.\n\"We're not in the business of replacing things,\" Sarid said. \"We're in the business of making things interoperable. That's a coherence that's really only enabled by APIs.\"\nAt the APIdays event, Sarid offered a medical example to make his point. Wearable devices now provide raw data on heart rate, sleep patterns, and more. Health APIs translate that into trends which are sent to physicians to analyze. Prescriptions are ordered, a delivery service is triggered and insurance companies are notified, all enabled by APIs.\nIt's putting the process of turning services into products on steroids, where each API represents services that companies can assemble into coherent offerings delivered through application networks.\n\"We should think of these as productized building blocks,\" Sarid said. \"That's really what the business understands.\" Lack of visibility a concern\nThe rush to mine gold from the API stream has not been without problems along the way. On Tuesday, one researcher noted that the most common vulnerability was a lack of visibility where security teams don't fully know all of the APIs in use within an organization.\nIn the information technology world, projects managed without the IT department's knowledge are often referred to as \"shadow IT.\" The API community is wrestling with this same issue.\n\"We're all familiar with shadow IT,\" said Francois Lascelles , field chief technology officer at Ping Identity Corp. \"Well, there's shadow APIs as well.\"\nThat lack of visibility can translate into problems once APIs are released into the wild. In November, it was discovered that an API vulnerability in an online service offered by the U.S. Postal Service inadvertently exposed account details of 60 million users.\nAnd in February, the property valuation firm LandMark White discovered that an exposed API leaked details and contact information for a number of its high profile clients.\nDespite these setbacks, APIs remain poised to play a major role in the global economy for years to come as businesses from e commerce sites to banks, from travel firms to healthcare join the parade. The journey may not always be smooth, but it is a notable chapter in the tech revolution.\n\"Good transformation, like a good sandwich, is always messy,\" said Axway's Pagano. \"This is an existential moment.\" Photo: Tanya Vlahovic/Twitter Since you're here \n We'd like to tell you about our mission and how you can help us fulfill it.

technology while watching the adventures of Captain Kirk and crew on the starship Enterprise on an old black and white television as a kid in the 1960s. Cruising through the heavens at many times the speed of light, teleporting crews to various planets, and diagnosing illness or injury using a handheld device among many other feats of fancy; yes, these could be real one day.\nYet, thinking about it now, I wonder if Kirk's refrigerator could order fresh supplies or if his advanced mobile device could, using geofencing, open his garage door, turn on some lights and activate the HVAC system. Oh, but the Internet of Things (IoT) was probably old hat for Kirk and his contemporaries. I advanced from cleaning furnace pilot burners to setting up a local Z wave network in what seem to be a progression comparable to the speed of light. In Figure 1\n2008, my job as a field service representative with the residential business of Trane Canada took a dramatic shift into the world of internet based technology. Ingersoll Rand (IR) had acquired Trane that year promising shareholders a great adventure in finding the elusive corporate synergy needed to \"enhance the potential for improved growth, earnings and cash flow.\" Just a few weeks later, I was introduced to the people behind IR's pioneering entrance into IoT. A sister company called Schlage, a door hardware and security business, had developed a line of high security residential deadbolt door locks that talked to the internet using a Z wave bridge through a portal called SchlageLink. Where is the synergy?The newly integrated door lock and HVAC business units, under IR's umbrella, talked about how a busy HVAC company might want to offer a customer a new deadbolt door lock and Wi Fi camera as an add on sale to the HVAC ticket. It could work, right? What HVAC contractor wouldn't want to make a few extra dollars changing out a door lock? Figure 2\nI quickly learned that not all doors are the same, especially the hole size and lock set back from the door's edge. Schlage's original deadbolt lock body required a 2 1/8 in. (54 mm) hole in the door. Being a door hole neophyte, I discovered after trying to install a lock at my house, the hole made in my door was only 1 \u00bd in. (38 mm) and it was chopped out with a chisel, not professionally drilled with a hole saw (as shown in Figure 1). Figure 3\nHow does one enlarge such an opening to the required size? I discovered that I could utilize a widely available jig made for undrilled doors to help in enlarging the existing hole out to the 2 1/8\" requirement. As you can see in Figure 2, the body of the new lock covered the leftover screw holes. The so called starter kit consisted of a deadbolt door lock, one Wi Fi camera, a Z wave light module and a\nZ wave internet portal often called a \"bridge\" or \"hub.\" In theory, the consumer would be interested in having the ability to enter several codes into the door lock, maybe one code for the kids, another for mom and dad, and perhaps another for the Figure 4 What a great installation\nbabysitter. The system could have been configured so that a child entering his or her code into the deadbolt would not only allow access but also turn on the camera pointed at the door and perhaps a nearby light. The image of the children entering the house would be recorded for the parents to review later or a real time alert may have been sent to one or both parents indicating the children's codes had been entered.\nEARLY ADOPTERS IR's home automation kit proved to be ahead of the curve, the term Internet of Things didn't yet exist in the lexicon. Except for the really tech savvy HVAC diehards, very few industry people knew enough about local area networks (LAN), SSID's, IP addresses and password protection security. The starter kit proved to be a non starter with HVAC contractors. Once we discovered the difficulties involved in setting up a customer's LAN (including asking embarrassing questions such as \"What is your router password\") and the issues related to home routers, the whole exercise fell into the bin of unrequited synergy. The internet was such an innocent place then \u2013 leaving the router default password unchanged was no more unusual than leaving one's front door unlocked back in the day. THE INTERNET IS A DARK, MYSTERIOUS PLACE Since my first adventures in the IoT field, a cornucopia of IoT devices has flooded the market. At one time, getting a Z Wave hub into a customer's home meant additional Z Wave device sales, but that is so 2008 now. The hubs sold at big box stores or other supply houses can deal with any radio frequency now \u2013 although integrating some of the third party devices into any given network may not be easy. As well, Apple's \"Siri\", Google's \"Nest Hub\" and Amazon's \"Echo\" operate as smart hubs that link to many IoT devices. The internet is commonly described as a global network of interconnected computers. There are so many ways the internet adds value to everyday financial and social transactions that the benefits are incalculable. However, the internet was not designed to resist iniquitous behaviour by criminals and has become something akin to a gladiatorial arena for many users. Even simple coding errors can cause massive disruptions for many. Some examples: In 2013, hackers stole an HVAC company's login credentials for Target Stores building automation system and leveraged this access to upload malware onto the Point of Sale system thus gaining access to information about 40 million debit and credit cards in the U.S. Russia and Brazil. CBC's TV program, Marketplace, hired benevolent hackers to force entry into a family's DIY home automation system purchased at a big box store. The hackers successfully manipulated the door lock, lights and HVAC system from a vehicle parked in front of the house. WikiLeaks revealed that the CIA had developed spyware software called \"Weeping Angel.\" It was used to turn on the microphone in television sets manufactured by a large South Korean conglomerate. The TV's software also contains credit card details for in app purchases. Anything you or your kids say after the wake up words like \"okay Google\" or \"Alexa\" can be overheard and recorded by Amazon and Google. Theoretically, after the command instruction has been enabled, the device should turn off. However, if Alexa hears you talking about buying a new car, expect auto industry ads to start popping up on your social media feeds. Actor James Franco quipped: \"My wife asked me why I spoke so softly in the house. I said I was afraid Mark Zuckerberg was listening! She laughed. I laughed. Alexa laughed. Siri laughed.\" In January 2016, a smart thermostat manufacturer pushed out a buggy update that created untold numbers of no heat situations. The company's service agreement forbids end users from suing for damages caused by thermostats failing to operate the furnace properly. This past winter, another manufacturer's buggy software update caused many furnaces to overheat the building while others simply failed to call for heat. THEY ARE WRECKING EVERYTHING! Whether it is a state actor or a bored teenager, there seems to be a concerted effort by the dark internet underbelly of demented players to hobble an otherwise important tool at least as significant as the Industrial Revolution. IoT devices, cynically known as \"malware ready\" by those eager to destroy them, are particularly vulnerable. Bot networks containing Trojan horses and other malware aimed at your network may not crash your devices. Your computer or smart device may be used to attack some other device or turn your device into a storage medium for child pornography and such, all without your knowledge. In 2017, malware known as \"BrickerBot\" attacked IoT devices between April and December. BrickerBot's unknown author claimed to have permanently destroyed over ten million IoT devices. Recently, a 14 year old hacker going by the pseudonym \"Light Leafon\" destroyed over 2000 (and counting) IoT devices using malware he calls \"Silex.\" Light Leafon boasted on social media that his \"project\" started as a joke but, as he is having so much fun, it is now become a full time obsession causing him to drop all his other botnet activities. Wherever wireless networks exist, there is potentially someone looking to break into it. Hackers known as \"war drivers\" search for Wi Fi networks from a moving vehicle using a laptop computer or smartphone to troll a network of interest. Using a GPS device, war drivers can record and later map the location of vulnerable wireless networks. And, wouldn't you know it, war driving software is freely available on, you guessed it, the internet! THERE MUST BE AN UPSIDE The internet is an awesome tool. HVAC engineers and designers have quick access to mechanical and electrical specifications including submittals and product catalogues; service and installation departments use online Installation, Operation and Maintenance materials and, of course, have the all important access to parts information. Technicians with smart phones can gather not only written materials about specific products but some manufacturers provide QR codes and other methods to offer video instructions to on site personnel. Manufacturers now offer their HVAC customers to remotely monitor end user equipment from a web portal or smartphone app. Some homeowner and commercial Wi Fi thermostats can transmit precious data to HVAC contractors saving time and money when things go wrong. In fact, a smart thermostat connected to a communicating unit control will send alerts to the service contractor often before the customer knows anything is wrong. The end user must agree to monitoring, it is as simple as checking a box on the webpage that says something like this: \"Allow my registered HVAC dealer to perform remote diagnostics for my air conditioning and/or heating system.\" Smart thermostat manufacturers may offer free lifetime access to the end user; if the portal can support other smart devices, then the customer might incur an extra monthly fee. For example, Venstar Skyport Cloud Service works with non aligned HVAC contractors offering a fee based remote equipment monitoring services to residential and commercial facilities such as health clinics, restaurants and offices. Nexia Home Intelligence is aligned with Trane dealers, while a Carrier dealer can offer remote services through its Infinity System. missing the simplicity of bygone days Considering the nefarious side of the internet, HVAC contractors, may want to shy away from IoT. Web enabled thermostats will continue to work even if internet connection is lost for whatever reason, but, as we have seen, connected thermostats are not immune from buggy software and botnet attacks designed to destroy the device. Perhaps, as in the animal world, large herds of caribou are somewhat \"immune\" from predator attacks because it is typically only the weakest members who get taken: the old, the sick and the young are most vulnerable. In truth, the predators actually perform a service for the herd by removing diseased members and preventing overpopulation. Thus, in the IoT world, the strong security/16 character password types (the herd) are the least likely to be attacked by evil hackers (the predators); then again, perhaps my analogy is a bit too simple? When things do not work in the internet world, what is an HVAC contractor to do? Maybe the furnace is working, but when it is not talking to the internet whose fault is that? Or, a bot just trashed the thermostat and your e mail is subsequently spammed with ten thousand calls for service. \"Captain Kirk, time warp back and fix our internet, please!\" <>\nIan McTeer is an HVAC consultant with 35 years experience in the industry.

In BGP route tables, ISPs are identified by an AS (Autonomous System) number.\nSEE: 10 tips for new cybersecurity pros (free PDF)\nA problem with the system is that it's difficult to know for sure whether a BGP hijacking event is actually malicious or just an accident. Researchers have in the past identified highly suspicious events because traffic from major companies like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google was wrongly rerouted. The other sign is the location and reputation of the ISP that caused it.\nOther times, it's more clear cut that an event is malicious, but internet infrastructure providers can still be wrongly routing traffic according to an attacker's plan for hours before they can rectify the problem.\nThe US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is working on a proposal that could thwart many BGP hijacking events.\nIt involves Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to allow cloud providers and ISPs that hold blocks of internet addresses to control which networks can announce a direct connection to their address block.\nIt's also working on BGP Validation so that routers can use RPKI information to filter out unauthorized BGP route announcements.\nResearchers at MIT are working on the detection side of the problem using a machine learning model to \"automatically identify Autonomous Systems (ASes) that exhibit characteristics similar to serial hijackers.\"\nThe gist of the effort is to help network operators proactively respond to ISPs that have a track record for bad behavior rather than only reacting to events after they happen. As it is, network operators can only publicly call out bad behavior in network engineering mailing lists and hope other networks help correct the issue.\n\"Current hijack detection systems typically rely on assumptions of prefix ownership and track origin changes in the global routing table. If an event is detected, the victim network can react and attempt to get in contact with the perpetrator or its upstream networks to solve the problem,\" the MIT researchers explain in a paper 'Profiling BGP Serial Hijackers: Capturing Persistent Misbehavior in the Global Routing Table', which they'll present later this month in Amsterdam.\n\"However, many times this contact is not fruitful or not even possible. At that point, victims of hijacks are only left with the option of publicly disclosing the event in network operator mailing lists in the hope that peer pressure and manual interventions by other networks, such as filtering announcements or refusing to provide transit, will remediate the situation.\"\nThe researchers built the machine learning detection model based on the assertion that malicious BGP behavior by an actor is sometimes consistent over time. By analyzing actions over time, the researchers aimed to create a scoring system to indicate an operator's good or bad reputation.\nThe serial BGP hijackers they focus on are the ASes that have displayed malicious activity in the global routing table for several years.\n\"We take on a new perspective on illicit BGP activity: instead of looking at individual BGP hijacking events, we study the long term prefix advertisement dynamics in the global routing table in space and time.\"\nSpecifically, they looked at BGP announcement dynamics of serial hijacker ASes over five years in a bid to identify characteristics that separate them from well behaved ASes.\nSEE: Dear network operators, please use the existing tools to fix security\nOne of the serial hijackers in the study, AS197426, or BitCanal, was \"effectively cut off from the global internet\" last July, according to Oracle owned Dyn. The Portuguese company was described by a security researcher as a BGP \"hijack factory\" because of its persistent hijacking activity over the years.\nThe classifier also identified AS19529 as a hijacker network and AS134190 as a network that shows the most recent indications of potential serial hijacker behavior.\nWith this knowledge, it would be possible for network operators to deploy systems to automatically discard bad BGP routing announcements rather than relying on mailing lists.\nBut they also note possible problems with autonomous detection. For example, companies that provide protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are what they call 'benign serial hijackers' because the process of scrubbing DDoS traffic involves BGP hijacking.

The Office app provides a simple, integrated experience that puts the tools you need for working on a mobile device at the forefront of the experience. We started by combining the existing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint mobile apps into a single app. Doing so brings all of your Office documents together in one place, reduces the need to switch between multiple apps, and significantly reduces the amount of space used on your phone compared to multiple installed apps. We then added new capabilities that harness the strengths of mobile devices, such as the camera, to enable you to create content in uniquely mobile ways. Finally, we added a new Actions Pane that helps you accomplish many of the common mobile tasks you need to do all from one place. Camera integration lets you easily convert photos of documents and tables into Word and Excel files, while PowerPoint presentations can easily import photos from your camera roll. The new Actions pane supports a number of common tasks like creating PDFs from documents or photos, signing PDFs with your finger, scanning QR codes, and file transfers.

By bringing together Samsung branded hardware and Microsoft software and services, the two companies have formed a powerful juggernaut that represents a serious threat to Apple and an oblique challenge to Google, particularly in the enterprise market.\nTo be clear, the companies have worked together in the past and some have argued that the exact details of the partnership remain to be flushed out. Fair enough. But when you put together the number one smartphone market share presence of Samsung with the deeply entrenched position of Microsoft software and cloud based services, it's not hard to imagine a lot of very interesting possibilities that could grow out of the new arrangement.\nFor one, it helps each company overcome long running concerns that they've been missing out on important markets. Samsung has been chided for not having the software and services expertise and offerings of an Apple, which was theoretically going to make the Korean giant vulnerable as the hardware markets started to slow. On the other side, Microsoft rather notoriously failed to make any kind of dent in the smartphone market. Together, however, the complementary capabilities offered by the partnership give customers a wide range of powerful and attractive devices, along with leading edge services and software in the business world. Plus, the two companies don't really compete, making the collaboration that much more compelling. The consumer story is clearly much tougher, but even there, Microsoft's forthcoming game streaming services could certainly be an intriguing and compelling option for certain consumers. On top of that, the combination of Samsung and Microsoft is likely to attract interest from other third party consumer services (Spotify or Netflix anyone?) that would be interested in joining the party. \"When you put together the number one smartphone market share presence of Samsung with the deeply entrenched position of Microsoft software and cloud based services, it's not hard to imagine a lot of very interesting possibilities that could grow out of the new arrangement.\"\nBut there are additional benefits to the partnership as well. For one, it clearly helps tie PCs and smartphones together in a much more capable and blended way. To Apple's credit, their Continuity features that link iPhones, iPads and Macs in an organized fashion were the first to make multiple devices operate as a single entity. However, despite Apple's overall strength, the percentage of people who only own Apple devices is actually pretty small\u2014in the single digit percentage range according to my research. The percentage of people who have Windows PCs and Android based phones, on the other hand, is enormous. Obviously, Samsung only owns a portion of that total, but it's a big enough percentage to make for a very significant competitor.\nMore importantly, the combination of Microsoft and Samsung also further breaks down the walls between different operating systems and highlights the value the cloud can bring to a multi device, multi platform world. Samsung is still committed to Google's Android as its smartphone OS, but by integrating things like Office 365, OneDrive and more into its devices, they are making life easier for people who spend much of their time in the Windows world. Conversely, Microsoft's expanding efforts with their Your Phone app in Windows 10 highlight the effort they're making to turn the process of using multiple devices into a more coherent experience. Unique Samsung specific extensions promised for that app should make it even more compelling. For Google, the challenge will be continuing to build the presence of apps like G Suite and other enterprise focused services in spite of its leading Android partner choosing Microsoft for some of its business based offerings.\nThe deal extends beyond smartphones as well. Though Samsung has been tiny player in the Windows PC market for several years, they made a bit of a splash at the event by introducing the Samsung Galaxy Book , the first Windows based always connected PC (ACPC) using Qualcomm's third generation PC focused processor the 8CX. While there are clearly still challenges in that space, the fact that it's a Samsung, Microsoft, Qualcomm partnership in PCs exemplifies again how far the tech industry has evolved over the last several years.\nWe're clearly still in the very early days of analyzing what the potential impact of the Samsung and Microsoft partnership will mean. But even a casual glance would suggest that there are very interesting things still to come.

(\"Turn it on?\") But there will soon exist so many high profile streaming services that the concept of watching TV \u2014 and how to do it without breaking your bank account \u2014 will be redefined.\nApple TV+ debuts Friday with episodes from nine original series and plans to release much more. Disney+ will come out within two weeks. In fact, over the next six months or so, at least five major new streaming services will debut, bursting with original shows, reboots and well regarded reruns. They will serve an audience where 69 percent of people have at least one streaming subscription , with the average consumer subscribing to three. (If you just want to see the costs and features of each streaming service, you can scroll to the bottom or click here. To see what an average menu of services might cost, click here.)\nIt's a new TV universe, one where you, the viewer, have never had more power to choose what you see. But there's so much to choose from that it can feel overwhelming. Frustration and \"subscription fatigue\" are growing. Even if your pocketbook can handle signing up for every streaming service, you can't possibly watch all the programming.\nUsually, a guide like this would just tell you what services to buy. But in this new era, we're giving you information to make those choices yourself. Buckle up. It's going to be a fun ride. Assemble Your Strategy\nAccept that this will be overwhelming at first. It's time for a new perspective on TV. For decades, you put up an antenna, maybe bought a cable package, and that was your TV universe. No longer. Wrapping your brain around all the choices will take time. Researchers say consumers are terrible at this kind of purchasing decision, which requires sorting through lots of difficult to compare information.\nTrack your viewing. Ask yourself: What TV shows, channels and platforms do I actually use the most? Which broadcast channels, cable services and streaming platforms include most of what I like? You wouldn't fill a bookshelf with books you might read, so don't crowd your media diet with random services, either. One big question: Do you need cable TV? Many people don't; I keep it mostly for ready access to live events and broadcast TV stations without an antenna, but you might feel differently.\nCreate a TV diary. One tip, borrowed from the dieting world, involves writing down what you watch on TV every day for a week or two. It will be different from what you imagine you watch every day, I promise. It's the best way to figure out what you're actually watching and what you're willing to spend to see it.\nExperiment. For viewers used to the burdensome process of obtaining (and dropping) cable service, this may seem odd. But many streaming services start and stop memberships with a couple of clicks. So don't be afraid to try a service, then change or cancel it after a few months if it's not working for you. Several also offer a free trial period. Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced Apple TV during a launch event in March. The service is now live. Noah Berger / AFP via Getty Images Assemble The Field\nSometimes knowing a streaming service's purpose can help you figure out if it fits into your life. I group them into five tiers; an effective TV strategy will involve a mix of them.\nMegaproviders : TV platforms that want to provide all or most of the programs you watch. These are services with extensive libraries, including lots of original and repurposed content. In this tier, I put established services like Netflix and Hulu, along with new platforms like Disney+ and HBO Max. Recommendation: A smart consumption strategy would include one to three of these services as a baseline.\nAdd on services : These platforms don't offer enough content to handle all or most of your TV consumption but still may feature material important to you. Here, I would put the streaming apps for premium cable channels like Showtime and Starz, alongside established services like Amazon Prime Video, PBS Passport, CBS All Access and YouTube's subscription services (including Premium, Music and YouTube TV). There are also newer channels like ESPN+, BET+ and Apple TV+. Recommendation: Find only the services that feature the ongoing programs you want, and don't be afraid to tweak the mix every so often.\nQuirky faves : There are some streaming services focused on specific tastes. The anglophile platforms Acorn and BritBox, the comics oriented DC Universe, black focused Urban Movie Channel, horror movie focused Shudder and more. Recommendation: Be careful that these services offer content you can't get anywhere else. DC Universe, for example, may wind up sharing a lot of content with HBO Max.\nSeasonal picks : Some platforms may only have a few series you enjoy, so it may make sense to subscribe only when those shows have fresh episodes. Star Trek fans, for example, can wait until every episode from the latest season of Star Trek: Discovery is available on CBS All Access, then sign up for a monthlong binge. Any streamer can fit this category, depending on your tastes, but services with just a few original hits like Starz or Epix might be most appropriate. Recommendation: Tracking these picks takes effort but saves money. It also allows you to spread a limited budget over more services.\nFree stuff : Facebook Watch, Tubi, Sony Crackle and Shout! Factory TV, among other sites. Comcast/NBC's Peacock streaming service is expected to offer an ad supported version with no subscription fees for some cable and satellite TV customers. Recommendation: These services provide access to some cable channels, movies and original programming with no cost \u2014 but often with commercials.\nWhat one sample plan looks like : Here's one hypothetical array of streaming subscriptions. Disney+ for access to superhero and kids stuff. $6.99/month Netflix for access to its wide range of original movies and TV shows and rerun content. $15.99/month (premium tier) ESPN+ for access to live sports. $4.99/month HBO Now/HBO Max, for access to HBO originals. $14.99/month CBS All Access, because you love Star Trek. $6.99/month (for two months)\nTotal: $49.95/month, which is still cheaper than many cable TV packages. The Walt Disney Company exhibited details of its Disney+ streaming service at a Disney expo in August. The service goes live Nov. 12. Jesse Grant / Getty Images for Disney New Services\nApple TV+\nPrice : $4.99/month, with seven day free trial. Those who purchase a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV unit, Mac computer or iPod touch receive a year's free subscription. Debuts Nov. 1.\nFeatures : Available through Apple TV app, select smart TVs and online. Through Family Sharing, up to six family members can use one subscription. Video in 4K HDR with Dolby Atmos.\nContent : Commercial free and all original. Service debuts with episodes from nine new shows, including Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston's The Morning Show ; Jason Momoa's drama about a world where most humans are blind, called See ; a retelling of poet Emily Dickinson's coming of age story, Dickinson ; a new version of Oprah Winfrey's book club.\nMy take : Apple may face the biggest challenges among these new streamers. The company reportedly has spent billions on new content without much idea about what users expect from an Apple TV+ original. Often, it takes platforms awhile to discover what content works with its audience, and here there's no catalog of older shows to draw users if originals flop. And the first crop of new shows doesn't seem to have a breakout hit (though keep your eyes open for Little America , executive produced by Kumail Nanjiani and Alan Yang).\nDisney+\nPrice : $6.99/month or $69.99/annually, with seven day free trial; $12.99/month for bundle with Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu (with ads). Verizon wireless customers who buy the company's wireless unlimited plans, Fios Home Internet or 5G Home Internet services can also receive 12 months of Disney+ free. Debuts Nov. 12.\nFeatures : Commercial free with up to four concurrent streams and unlimited downloads with support for up to 4K HDR video. Subscribers can create up to seven profiles, including kids' profiles with parental controls.\nContent : Streaming home for movies and shows from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic. Exclusive streaming home for films released by Walt Disney Studios in 2019 and beyond, including Avengers: Endgame and Toy Story 4. Thirty seasons of episodes from The Simpsons. Original projects include The Mandalorian , the first scripted live action Star Wars series; Loki from Marvel Studios and the Toy Story based animated series Forky Asks a Question from Pixar.\nMy take : Disney has loads of desirable content available at a modest price (at least, right now). The company has spent months carefully revealing its service to the world and cultivating early subscribers. Families and genre geeks will be an important core constituency.\nHBO Max\nPrice : $14.99/month, launching in May 2020. Subscribers who get HBO through AT&T, and customers of the existing platform HBO Now will receive it at no additional cost. The service is different and more expansive than current platforms HBO Now and HBO GO, which just stream content from the premium cable channel HBO.\nContent : 10,000 hours of programming from WarnerMedia outlets, including the entire HBO service, TNT, TBS, truTV, CNN documentaries, DC Entertainment, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim and Warner Bros. New shows include a Game of Thrones prequel called House of the Dragon. Exclusive streaming home for all 236 episodes of Friends and all 279 episodes of The Big Bang Theory , along with all 23 seasons of the animated comedy South Park. HBO Max will be home for new seasons of Sesame Street , the show's 50 year library and four new Sesame Workshop shows. It'll also feature reboots of shows such as The Boondocks , streaming of at least 12 seasons of Doctor Who , and new projects from creators like Ellen DeGeneres, Reese Witherspoon and Steven Soderbergh.\nMy take : The company has opened its pocketbook wide to gather a sprawling array of content, featuring lots of beloved shows and stars. But it doesn't yet seem focused into a recognizable strategy. It may dilute the power of HBO's brand. The price point may be discouraging, and with a debut date set for next May, it will premiere after all its major competitors.\nPeacock\nPrice : Service will have an ad supported version and a subscription version; no details released yet on either option. Debuts April 2020.\nContent : Over 15,000 hours of material from owner Comcast/NBCUniversal. Streaming home for reruns of American version of The Office and Parks and Recreation. Reboots of the sci fi series Battlestar Galactica , the teen comedy Saved by the Bell and the sitcom Punky Brewster , along with a weekly talk show featuring writer/performer Amber Ruffin from Late Night with Seth Meyers and films from the Fast & Furious and Jason Bourne franchises.\nMy take : As one of the last new services to debut, it may be the most affected by \"subscriber fatigue.\" But its ad supported version may encourage more sampling.\nQuibi\nPrice : Fee is $4.99/month for service with commercials; $7.99/month for ad free subscription. Debut scheduled for April 6, 2020.\nFeatures : Mobile first app featuring short form video content designed for viewing on portable devices. Most content will range from five to 10 minutes per episode.\nContent : The company has announced several development deals, including a version of The Fugitive featuring Kiefer Sutherland, a musical comedy series starring Darren Criss, a court show featuring model Chrissy Teigen as judge and a partnership with CBS' 60 Minutes to create original, six minute stories under the title 60 in 6.\nMy take : Former eBay and Hewlett Packard CEO Meg Whitman and Dreamworks founder Jeffrey Katzenberg have teamed up to lead the company, which has announced several high profile projects but not yet made any programs available to see. It'll need a super buzzy original series to cut through all the media clutter surrounding streaming by April. HBO unveiled details of its HBO Max service at a WarnerMedia investor presentation in late October. It's scheduled to go live in May 2020.

Each year brings more and more compelling solutions to make streaming easier, more cost effective, more efficient, or even to provide a look into the business, which heretofore had not been possible. One or more of these could be a great addition to your toolbox and help you stay ahead of the innovation curve. Many of the companies here provided demo accounts, so we were able to kick the tires and get a look under the hood. Others didn't, but we feel they're worth your consideration.\nThis is only a smattering of the new products on the market. This is also just the first installment in a recurring series, so feel free to contact the author about your latest products. Datazoom\nVideo Player Data Consolidator\nEveryone knows that data collection and analysis are crucial to success, but many tools on the market offer only limited views into the data you need. Because delivery happens on multiple platforms, trying to track and compare data based on absolute measurements is impossible without a tool to normalize the data. Datazoom lets customers take player data from multiple sources and map it into a standardized dataset for better perspectives into their operations or to feed information into machine learning (ML) and AI tools.\n\"We need a more fundamental layer of data that we can use across multiple types of functions,\" says Diane Strutner, Datazoom's CEO. Building queries in Google Analytics without Datazoom requires familiarity with all the nomenclature for every single datapoint necessary for a specific metric. For example, each of the 20 players might call the play event something different. \"You'd have to say show me how many 'plays,'play requested,'content requested,' and 'play starts,' because that's the level of variance between all the platforms at a raw data level that we're dealing with today,\" says Strutner. \"We provide an interface for customers so that they can select the data they want to include in their dataset.\"\nSo how does Datazoom standardize data? Customers set up lectors to work with and then select a connector to output to. They support a wide range of video players and have created a dictionary for more than 1,700 player datapoints that users can reference when setting up queries. There are three general categories: Event (full API monitoring), Metadata (player, browser, response header), and FluxData (collected at predetermined intervals). These enable customers to consistently measure things like failed video starts, average bitrate, or rebuffering rate across all platforms.\nDatazoom lets customers replace some vendor SDKs with their own to capture information via WebSocket instead of HTTP(S), making more compute power available for video delivery. \"We have a unique architecture that includes a data retry mechanism that continues to retry data to the destination until our platform has 100% confirmation that data transferred was received. We built this because we noticed in our development that third party services were missing percentages of data, particularly during scale testing,\" Strutner says.\n\"A lot of companies are trying to come up with their data strategy. We provide a very agile way to collect and experiment with data without requiring engineering resources,\" says Strutner. \"That's not been possible before. So, what we do through Datazoom is illuminate the types of data you can have, create a pathway to capture and standardize the data, and then send this into other tools like you've never had before.\"\nPros: Consolidated data reporting, straightforward user interface, solid documentation\nCons: Player data only at this time. (CDN log support is in beta.)\nPricing: Pricing per GB of data transacted on platform\nDatazoom lets customers take player data from multiple sources and map it into a standardized dataset for better perspectives into their operations or to feed information into machine learning (ML) and AI tools. Wicket Labs\nSubscription Video Data Analysis\nWicket Labs provides tools focused on reducing churn and improving the lifetime value of video customers. The company describes itself as a subscription video insights platform where customers can connect analytics from digital properties, online video platforms, QoS tools, subscriber management, and other marketing and internal databases or data lakes (pools of raw, undefined data).\n\"We talked to our friends in the industry, and it turns out they were still struggling with aggregating data from all these different sources,\" says Marty Roberts, CEO and co founder of Wicket Labs. \"The top three data sources we pull from are subscriber and payment management systems, app and site analytics, and the online video platform. Marketing automation systems are a close fourth.\"\nFrom these sources, the company compiles data about average revenue per user (ARPU), per user acquisition costs, identification of which outreach (advertising, social media, etc.) or promotion is working, what content keeps viewers engaged, popularity by viewing platform, and many more datapoints. Wicket Labs has the ability to process up to 3 years' worth of data.\nSo, what trends has the company seen? \"Eighty percent of insights and problems are pretty similar across all of our customers,\" says Roberts. \"We can say about 64.7% of all free trials convert. Scaling to 25,000 subs is a key milestone to show a valid business model. Identifying what kind of marketing campaigns are adding new subscribers and reducing churn are a common focus. For customers with 100,000+ subscribers, the effectiveness of content licensing (or content creation) becomes a focus.\"\nProduct teams find that, on average, Apple TV or Roku viewers tend to churn at half the rate as those who primarily watch on iOS and Android. Content licensing teams can identify hidden gems (like less well known shows that people will watch to completion), which would benefit from more promotion.\nThey also run ML to identify ideal customer traits and then design look alike campaigns on Facebook. \"As you would expect, your happiest customers become a really good reference set,\" Roberts says. \"In one customer's case [using this approach meant their acquisition costs were] 24% lower than they'd ever seen before.\"\nCustomers can then inject this data back into existing systems so it can be used to further develop subscriber intelligence, says Roberts. \"Customers start to understand, 'Am I good or bad relative to the other SVOD [subscription video on demand] services?' and they can strategically plan based on this data.\"\nPros: Provides valuable insight for subscription based business models; enables customers to see where they should continue to devote resources\nCons: Not for ad supported content. Wicket Labs did not provide a demo account, so we have no further insight into the product.\nPricing: Based on the number of active audience subscriptions, including trialists and paying subscribers\nWicket Labs lets subscription video services analyze which content is working, then design promotional campaigns that leverage this information to generate more subscribers. Stringr\nOriginal and Stock Photography Platform\nStringr's core product is a technologically enabled video marketplace. Customers in broadcast, publishing, brands, and ad agencies can source content they need from professionals, amateurs, or leading content partners\u2014Getty, Shutterstock, and Storyful.\n\"We have about 300,000 videos in our archive that can be searched, and we also have a good amount of partner content,\" says Lindsay Stewart, CEO and founder. \"If you don't see what you like there, you can assign work.\"\nCustomers make location based requests. They can be for raw, prerecorded footage; produced prerecorded footage; or live coverage. Once the request is submitted, it goes out to a network of videographers who can decide, on spec, to shoot the requested footage. Fees vary according to distribution.\nThey have two tiers of shooters among the 100,000 videographers on their platform: Stringr Professional and Stringr Crowd. Stringr Pros are routinely rated as excellent by customers, and they have high end equipment and experience to match. Their expertise is suitable for high profile shoots. Currently, these shooters are in the U.S. and the U.K., but Stringr expects to expand to the rest of Europe by late fall.\nStringr Pro shooters will live stream content. \"Sometimes you don't want tape [prerecorded]; you actually want to cover something live, whether it's breaking news or a corporate event,\" says Stewart. \"We can enable that as well.\"\nStringr also produces edited content with a team of producers and editors to create a finished product that you can publish, air, or put wherever you want, says Stewart. The company has a 24/7 curation team to answer questions and create metadata so customers can search based on time, date, location, or keyword description. This detailed search capability is unique, according to Stewart.\nStringr Crowd videographers can take on lower budget projects as well as enable newer shooters to develop experience. (Stringr has even created a whole set of tutorials and a YouTube channel for instruction.)\nAnother service Stringr has built is a white label editor on the platform, as well as a player so content owners can take whatever they've edited and quickly publish it anywhere. This was done in response to clients having a hard time easily placing content into existing properties. \"This a tool we largely built for publishers,\" says Stewart. \"Basically, it gives you an I frame code. You could take that code and put it in your publishing tool, and you have a very high caliber player which you can make monetization decisions around.\"\nPros: Ability to get the exact content needed by assigning work as long as there's a shooter in the area, 24/7 support staff, consolidated search of Stringr and three other stock agencies' content\nCons: Navigation takes a little time to get used to. We only looked at the platform and didn't hire a videographer, so we have no feedback on that process.\nPricing: Customers buy credits for immediate or future use, at different rates for Crowd and Pro videos.\nStringr lets you quickly source both prerecorded footage and live coverage from professional and amateur videographers in the U.S. and U.K. Vimond\nCollaborative Cloud Video Editor\nVimond created Vimond IO, a fully collaborative application for editing live or video on demand (VOD) content for instant output to multiple destinations. This cloud based product can introduce both cost and time savings for customers. \"What we are seeing now is that more and more companies are open to the idea of replacing some of their traditional broadcast equipment,\" says Kenneth Cuomo, product manager at Vimond. This extends to both hardware and software.", "URL": "https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=135134"}, {"Title": "Music piracy is thriving in the age of streaming [op-ed]", "Text": "opinion Opinion October 8, 2019 Music piracy is thriving in the age of streaming [op ed] Share on twitter Share on facebook 0 shares\nLast month, a 19 year old was arrested in Ipswich after a joint effort between the City Of London Police, and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. The investigation spanned two continents, many months, and involved intel provided by two international organisations. A search warrant was procured, houses in North London and Ipswich were targeted, and the arrest was made.\nThe crime? Music piracy.\nWhen was the last time you heard of someone pirating music? It seems like a relic of the past, doesn't it? A friend hands you a CD R with the new Wilco album on it, or maybe a hard drive with the whole Wilco catalogue. Maybe Wilco's music wasn't even involved at all. Maybe you just taped some songs off the radio.\nMusic piracy in one form or another has been around for generations. In the '60s, publishers were worried about unauthorised reproduction of lyrics cutting into the sales of sheet music. In the '70s, it was concert bootleggers, such as those who trailed the Grateful Dead bus and recorded shows on gear so cumbersome you needed ancient Egyptians to haul it.\nIn the '80s, with the proliferation of the cassette, home taping was \"killing music\". In the '90s, it was CD burners helping burn musicians' profits. Then in 1999, as if to sign point the way to a brave new millennium, Napster arrived and music piracy went digital, a decentralised black market network primarily operated by millions worldwide, most of whom had no real understanding of the copyright implications of downloading that shitty sounding Blink 182 MP3.\nAs I have previously written in this column, Apple's iTunes was launched in 2001 as a way to facilitate the easy pirating of copyrighted material, with its brazen slogan 'Rip. Mix. Burn' being the spiritual opposition to 'Home Taping Is Killing Music'.\nAll of these piracy systems were just technological progressions with the same end in sight: to pirate material that was already commercially released. EMI and Sony BMG tried to fight this in 2001 with special Copy Control CDs which couldn't be played in computers, and therefore couldn't be burnt. Turns out they couldn't be played in numerous car CD players either, or some disc stackers. Some just wouldn't play at all Technically, they weren't even CDs, just expensive shiny frisbees that dressed like CDs but acted like petulant children. It was an expensive failure, a PR headache, and they were quickly discontinued.\nTurns out the best way to stop music piracy wasn't to fight the march of technology, nor to launch laughable scare campaigns with FBI logos and threats of jail time. The way to stop music piracy was to complete devalue music.\nWith the majority of music able to be accessed for a tenner a month through legitimate streaming services, it seems crazy to slyly slip your friend a hard drive with a knowing grin that says, 'Yup, ALL the Wilco albums.'\nThe arrest last month was a little different. The culprit was \" allegedly accessing world famous recording artists' websites and cloud based accounts illegally, stealing unreleased songs, and selling the stolen music in exchange for cryptocurrency\". In other words, he was trading in material that was either slated for future release, or shelved and never intended to be released at all. He wasn't stealing already available music, and he wasn't freely trading it. There was a price involved. The pirate had found a way to make music valuable again.\nIn June, Radiohead dumped 18 hours of unreleased music onto Bandcamp, after someone hacked into Thom Yorke's computer and stole recordings spanning three years. \"We got hacked last week\u2014someone stole Thom's minidisk archive from around the time of OK Computer , and reportedly demanded $150,000 on threat of releasing it,\" Jonny Greenwood explained.\n\"So instead of complaining\u2014much\u2014or ignoring it, we're releasing all 18 hours on Bandcamp in aid of [charity] Extinction Rebellion. Just for the next 18 days. So for \u00a318 you can find out if we should have paid that ransom.\" Thom Yorke was more brief, writing \"it's not v interesting, there's a lot of it.\" This style of hacking isn't new. Album leaks became almost de rigueur in the '00s, but didn't seem to compromise sales to the extent that many feared. In many cases, such as with Radiohead's Kid A in 2000, sections of which appeared on file sharing services months before release, it helped whet appetites and resulted in their first U.S. #1. Like most piracy concerns throughout history, they were unfounded.\nComplaining about music piracy is seen as decidedly un rock and roll, too. Metallica were the sacrificial lambs that copped enormous backlash for suing their own fans, even if history has proven they were right to be worried about the rise of digital piracy. When The Grateful Dead realised their shows were being taped, rather than attempt to police it, they provided a special area for the tapers behind the sound desk. \"We didn't want to be cops,\" drummer Mickey Hart explained.\nSometimes it was written into the release plan. In 1991, Guns N Roses guitarist Slash explained that the idea behind the band releasing Use Your Illusion I and II on the same day as two separate albums, rather than as a double, was because the price of a double album would make it prohibitively expensive for the average teenager to buy; as separate albums, two mates could buy one each, and tape the other. I'm paraphrasing, he probably didn't say 'mates'.\nBut those were different times. The Use Your Illusion albums sold 11 million copies between them in the U.S. alone. And The Grateful Dead believe money is nothing but an illusion to be used. Music doesn't sell anymore. But there is money to be made if the release is handled correctly. Artists have to be smart with the timing, in order to properly impact chart positions, and capitalise with touring schedules. Often lucrative deals are struck with streaming services for a window of exclusivity, deals that become negated if the music is already freely available.\nWhereas previous 'leaks' involved somebody in the inner circle breaching trust, or an unscrupulous or unthinking journalist passing along an advance copy, now it is anyone with an internet connection that can access an artist's files.\nIn a W magazine cover story just last week, Frank Ocean spoke of the lengths he goes to in order to keep his music protected. He is currently working with a string arranger in Rio, a process that naturally involves a lot of back and forth. \"Because I don't put things on the Internet,\" he explained, \"I have to send a drive with someone to Rio, or I have to go myself.\"\nThink of that. It seems like extreme paranoia, but it's not really. It's simply the only secure way to protect one of his most valuable assets \u2013 his unreleased music.\nThis problem won't go away, either. These security breaches aren't a flaw in the internet that needs to be fixed, they are baked into its very design. The internet was created to be breakable. It's built upon open source code, to be modified and accessed by many different users across a vast, unseen network of computers. Anyone hoping to store sensitive material on the internet is pushing against its very design. It's why hacking is so commonplace, it's why we need passwords, and it's also why those passwords aren't sufficient and need to be changed every 15 minutes.\nBut it's too late to start again. So, as my service to the music industry , I spoke to Detective Inspector Nick Court. He works for the City Of London Police's Intellectual Property Crime Unit, and was the man behind the arrest of the 19 year old pirate at the top of this story. I asked him if music piracy is a rising concern for his organisation, and what he feels artists can do to protect their work.\n\"I think it is reasonable to say that the problem of piracy generally has increased in recent years,\" he explains, \"as computers, phones and networks become more powerful and more people globally are online and have an appetite for content.\n\"In terms of protection advice, this is similar to general cyber 'good housekeeping' \u2013 so keep firewalls up to date and make passwords hard to guess and change them regularly. Try not to have the same password for multiple accounts because a breach of one can lead to a breach in many.\"\nThat's not very comforting. Basically the same rules apply to your Gmail as a vault of unreleased masters worth millions.\nThere is another answer, though. Don't use computers connected to the internet to record or store music. Even this might not do it. Computers don't even need to be connected to the internet to be hacked, they just need the ability to be connected.\nSo, what now? My advice to artists is to pull out the old four track tape machine, put egg cartons on the walls to dull the sound, and hit record. As we round the bases towards 2020, home taping might not be killing music anymore, it may just be its saviour.

That's the way plenty of us feel whenever we see someone blaming video games for every new armed atrocity that shocks the world. Look, we get it, video games are an easy target. It's far easier to blame them for somebody acting violently than it is to confront the tangled, messy, complex web of interrelated reasons that's actually at fault. But it doesn't mean that we should power down our critical thinking, just because we want easy answers. Donald Trump, the President of the United States, and other politicians recently used video games as a scapegoat to (at least in part) explain the recent shootings in El Paso and Dayton. However, the internet quickly reacted with a whole slew of original memes that hit back against this idea. Bored Panda collected the best of the best, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me , of memes showing how video games don't cause violence. Upvote the ones you love the most and leave a comment to let everyone know what you thought of the memes. Keep on scrolling, because the memes at the very bottom of the post get lonely sometimes (just don't feed them after midnight)! Professor Andrew Przybylski of the Oxford Internet Institute told Bored Panda that \"the idea that violent video games cause real world aggression has been with us for more than four decades but in this time there has been no convincing evidence that supports it.\" \"I'd observe that video games with combat, crime, and war are quite popular in Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the U.K., and these countries do not have the same problems with large numbers of shootings,\" noted Przybylski, who is an experimental psychologist and Director of Research at the Oxford Internet Institute. His work is concerned with applying psychological models of motivation and health to study how people interact with virtual environments.

Thatand#39;s getting Page 1 Rankings on YouTube and Google practically Instantly. =) When asked by Bored Panda why he thinks video games keep getting blamed for violence, Przybylski answered that \"research indicates that about half of the adult U.S. population plays games, I suspect that as this number rises (i.e. gamers age) this excuse will hold less water.\" The professor also mentioned that video games \"might\" desensitize people to violence, \"but it's likely that the effects are smaller and more nuanced than many assume.\" \"I think that games are a complex form of play and that gaming companies should share their data with independent researchers; not because games cause violence, but because they are now an essential part of our lives. It's their responsibility to our society as good corporate citizens,\" Professor Przybylski added. #2 A Cloud Based App That Creates INSTANT 1 Click Profitable Affiliate Funnels to Build You a HUGE List and Gets Targeted Traffic and Affiliate Commissions on 100% Autopilot.\nOn the 5th of August, Trump condemned \"racism, bigotry and white supremacy\", as well as video games for the most recent deadly shootings in the US.\n\"We must stop the glorification of violence in our society. This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace,\" said Trump. \"It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence.\" The 3rd and 4th of August were bloody days for the US: a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas on Saturday; while another attacker killed nine people in Dayton, Ohio, on Sunday. #3 #4\nTrump wasn't the only one stating that video games had something to do with the shootings, however. House Minority Leader and California Republican Kevin McCarthy shared similar thoughts: \"But the idea of these video games that dehumanize individuals to have a game of shooting individuals and others \u2014 I've always felt that is a problem for future generations and others. We've watched from studies shown before of what it does to individuals. When you look at these photos of how it took place, you can see the actions within video games and others.\" Article Genie Resellers 20\nMcCarthy may have a point about people getting slightly desensitized to violence through consuming media, but it's unclear what specific studies McCarthy referred to. The general consensus among the academic community is that there is no established link between playing video games and acting violently. #5 #6\nFurthermore, video games are played all across the globe, and yet, it's only the United States that has so many instances of gun violence. In 2018 alone, there were 340 mass shootings in the country. 340! 3 4 0!!!\nAccording to CNN, the US also has 57 times more school shootings than \"other major industrialized\" countries do, combined. Since 2009, the US has had more than 288 school shootings; Mexico is in second place with 8. Clearly, some other factors are to blame for American shootings, not Call of Duty. Hence, why the internet's very best meme engineers started working overtime to satirize the very notion that Game Boys and PlayStations create murderers. #7 Create upto 9 different types of Interactive Hotspots on top of your Images in a snap for More Sales and Leads.

In BGP route tables, ISPs are identified by an AS (Autonomous System) number.\nSEE: 10 tips for new cybersecurity pros (free PDF)\nA problem with the system is that it's difficult to know for sure whether a BGP hijacking event is actually malicious or just an accident. Researchers have in the past identified highly suspicious events because traffic from major companies like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google was wrongly rerouted. The other sign is the location and reputation of the ISP that caused it.\nOther times, it's more clear cut that an event is malicious, but internet infrastructure providers can still be wrongly routing traffic according to an attacker's plan for hours before they can rectify the problem.\nThe US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is working on a proposal that could thwart many BGP hijacking events.\nIt involves Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to allow cloud providers and ISPs that hold blocks of internet addresses to control which networks can announce a direct connection to their address block.\nIt's also working on BGP Validation so that routers can use RPKI information to filter out unauthorized BGP route announcements.\nResearchers at MIT are working on the detection side of the problem using a machine learning model to \"automatically identify Autonomous Systems (ASes) that exhibit characteristics similar to serial hijackers.\"\nThe gist of the effort is to help network operators proactively respond to ISPs that have a track record for bad behavior rather than only reacting to events after they happen. As it is, network operators can only publicly call out bad behavior in network engineering mailing lists and hope other networks help correct the issue.\n\"Current hijack detection systems typically rely on assumptions of prefix ownership and track origin changes in the global routing table. If an event is detected, the victim network can react and attempt to get in contact with the perpetrator or its upstream networks to solve the problem,\" the MIT researchers explain in a paper 'Profiling BGP Serial Hijackers: Capturing Persistent Misbehavior in the Global Routing Table', which they'll present later this month in Amsterdam.\n\"However, many times this contact is not fruitful or not even possible. At that point, victims of hijacks are only left with the option of publicly disclosing the event in network operator mailing lists in the hope that peer pressure and manual interventions by other networks, such as filtering announcements or refusing to provide transit, will remediate the situation.\"\nThe researchers built the machine learning detection model based on the assertion that malicious BGP behavior by an actor is sometimes consistent over time. By analyzing actions over time, the researchers aimed to create a scoring system to indicate an operator's good or bad reputation.\nThe serial BGP hijackers they focus on are the ASes that have displayed malicious activity in the global routing table for several years.\n\"We take on a new perspective on illicit BGP activity: instead of looking at individual BGP hijacking events, we study the long term prefix advertisement dynamics in the global routing table in space and time.\"\nSpecifically, they looked at BGP announcement dynamics of serial hijacker ASes over five years in a bid to identify characteristics that separate them from well behaved ASes.\nSEE: Dear network operators, please use the existing tools to fix security\nOne of the serial hijackers in the study, AS197426, or BitCanal, was \"effectively cut off from the global internet\" last July, according to Oracle owned Dyn. The Portuguese company was described by a security researcher as a BGP \"hijack factory\" because of its persistent hijacking activity over the years.\nThe classifier also identified AS19529 as a hijacker network and AS134190 as a network that shows the most recent indications of potential serial hijacker behavior.\nWith this knowledge, it would be possible for network operators to deploy systems to automatically discard bad BGP routing announcements rather than relying on mailing lists.\nBut they also note possible problems with autonomous detection. For example, companies that provide protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are what they call 'benign serial hijackers' because the process of scrubbing DDoS traffic involves BGP hijacking.

Developers have been playing with the platform for the past couple of months and attendees at E3 also got to go hands on with the new technology. The service will allow users to use their own Xbox as a game server, or use Microsoft's Xbox powered cloud platform to stream Xbox One games to a PC, TV, smartphone or tablet at home or on the go.\n\"Two months ago we connected all Xbox developers to Project xCloud,\" Xbox boss Phil Spencer told the E3 audience. The Xbox One streaming service will \"turn your Xbox One into your own personal and free xCloud server.\" \"On team Xbox, every decision is guided by the belief that gaming is for everyone,\" Spencer added. \"This is why we keep innovating hardware and services, and it's why we're uniting communities through cross play.\"\nMicrosoft hasn't revealed whether xCloud will cost additional money to activate, or whether it will be bundled into its Xbox Live subscriptions. As gamers will be streaming their own titles, and not subscribing to a gaming catalog as such, it is possible it could be a free value added service.

The Office app provides a simple, integrated experience that puts the tools you need for working on a mobile device at the forefront of the experience. We started by combining the existing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint mobile apps into a single app. Doing so brings all of your Office documents together in one place, reduces the need to switch between multiple apps, and significantly reduces the amount of space used on your phone compared to multiple installed apps. We then added new capabilities that harness the strengths of mobile devices, such as the camera, to enable you to create content in uniquely mobile ways. Finally, we added a new Actions Pane that helps you accomplish many of the common mobile tasks you need to do all from one place. Camera integration lets you easily convert photos of documents and tables into Word and Excel files, while PowerPoint presentations can easily import photos from your camera roll. The new Actions pane supports a number of common tasks like creating PDFs from documents or photos, signing PDFs with your finger, scanning QR codes, and file transfers. Office for mobile is available in public preview today, with the iOS preview running through Apple's TestFlight program and limited to the first 10,000 users. Users can gets basic access to the preview with no sign in required, but if you log in with a work, school, or personal Microsoft account you'll get access to all of your cloud based documents.

By bringing together Samsung branded hardware and Microsoft software and services, the two companies have formed a powerful juggernaut that represents a serious threat to Apple and an oblique challenge to Google, particularly in the enterprise market.\nTo be clear, the companies have worked together in the past and some have argued that the exact details of the partnership remain to be flushed out. Fair enough. But when you put together the number one smartphone market share presence of Samsung with the deeply entrenched position of Microsoft software and cloud based services, it's not hard to imagine a lot of very interesting possibilities that could grow out of the new arrangement.\nFor one, it helps each company overcome long running concerns that they've been missing out on important markets. Samsung has been chided for not having the software and services expertise and offerings of an Apple, which was theoretically going to make the Korean giant vulnerable as the hardware markets started to slow. On the other side, Microsoft rather notoriously failed to make any kind of dent in the smartphone market. Together, however, the complementary capabilities offered by the partnership give customers a wide range of powerful and attractive devices, along with leading edge services and software in the business world. Plus, the two companies don't really compete, making the collaboration that much more compelling. The consumer story is clearly much tougher, but even there, Microsoft's forthcoming game streaming services could certainly be an intriguing and compelling option for certain consumers. On top of that, the combination of Samsung and Microsoft is likely to attract interest from other third party consumer services (Spotify or Netflix anyone?) that would be interested in joining the party. \"When you put together the number one smartphone market share presence of Samsung with the deeply entrenched position of Microsoft software and cloud based services, it's not hard to imagine a lot of very interesting possibilities that could grow out of the new arrangement.\"\nBut there are additional benefits to the partnership as well. For one, it clearly helps tie PCs and smartphones together in a much more capable and blended way. To Apple's credit, their Continuity features that link iPhones, iPads and Macs in an organized fashion were the first to make multiple devices operate as a single entity. However, despite Apple's overall strength, the percentage of people who only own Apple devices is actually pretty small\u2014in the single digit percentage range according to my research. The percentage of people who have Windows PCs and Android based phones, on the other hand, is enormous. Obviously, Samsung only owns a portion of that total, but it's a big enough percentage to make for a very significant competitor.\nMore importantly, the combination of Microsoft and Samsung also further breaks down the walls between different operating systems and highlights the value the cloud can bring to a multi device, multi platform world. Samsung is still committed to Google's Android as its smartphone OS, but by integrating things like Office 365, OneDrive and more into its devices, they are making life easier for people who spend much of their time in the Windows world. Conversely, Microsoft's expanding efforts with their Your Phone app in Windows 10 highlight the effort they're making to turn the process of using multiple devices into a more coherent experience. Unique Samsung specific extensions promised for that app should make it even more compelling. For Google, the challenge will be continuing to build the presence of apps like G Suite and other enterprise focused services in spite of its leading Android partner choosing Microsoft for some of its business based offerings.\nThe deal extends beyond smartphones as well. Though Samsung has been tiny player in the Windows PC market for several years, they made a bit of a splash at the event by introducing the Samsung Galaxy Book , the first Windows based always connected PC (ACPC) using Qualcomm's third generation PC focused processor the 8CX. While there are clearly still challenges in that space, the fact that it's a Samsung, Microsoft, Qualcomm partnership in PCs exemplifies again how far the tech industry has evolved over the last several years.\nWe're clearly still in the very early days of analyzing what the potential impact of the Samsung and Microsoft partnership will mean. But even a casual glance would suggest that there are very interesting things still to come.

These principles are relatively harmless when it comes to developing an app for sharing photos, a social network, or a mobile messaging service. However, in the 1 5 years since Facebook, the technology industry has become a very different beast. Large scale data breaches occur almost every day, data collection at industrial level threatens democracies and artificial intelligence (AI) now permeates almost all facets of society \u2013 often to the chagrin of people.\nAlthough Facebook's mantra \"Make it quick and break things\" was officially dropped five years ago. At the core of many of today's problems seems to be that companies use a similar AI ethos as before \u2013 steam ahead and to hell with the consequences. \"Artificial stupidity\" Above: 3D rendering of robots that speak no evil, hear no evil, seeing no evil ,\nThis week it was revealed that Congress is exploring how facial recognition technology is used by the military in the US and abroad, noting that the technology is not accurate enough. [19659002] \"The operational benefits of the Warfighter's face recognition technology are promising,\" a letter from the congress said. \"Over reliance on this emerging technology, however, could also have catastrophic consequences if incorrect or inaccurate facial surveys lead to inadvertent civilian targeting or compromise on mission requirements.\"\nThe representation of black and female subjects was consistently lower than in white and male subjects. \"\nWhile there are countless other examples of how far AI needs to go to address algorithmic bias, the broader issue here is that AI is simply not good or trustworthy enough across the spectrum.\n\"Everyone wants to be up to date or up to date \u2013 from universities to businesses and government,\" Dr. Kristinn R. Th\u00f3risson, an AI researcher and founder of the Icelandic Institute of Intelligent Machinery, spoke in the same panel discussion as Carly Kind. \"And they think artificial intelligence is next [big]. But we are in the age of artificial stupidity. \"\nTh\u00f3risson is a leading advocate of so called Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which deals with the integration of different systems to create a more complex AI with human like attributes. like self learning, thinking and planning. Depending on who you ask, the AGI comes in 5 years, it's a long way or never happens \u2013 but Th\u00f3risson obviously believes the AGI will happen someday. If so, he is not so sure \u2013 but what he is sure is that today's machines are not as smart as some might think. In the past, people used to put their understanding in quotation marks when dealing with AI about it have spoken, \"said Th\u00f3risson. \"When it comes down to it, these machines really do not understand anything, and that's the problem.\"\nWith all the positive spins on how amazing AI is now when it comes to beating people in poker, AlphaGo or Honor of Kings, there are numerous examples of AI failures in the wild. In most cases, driverless cars are almost ready for rush hour, but there are other signs that there are still some obstacles to overcome before they can be left to their own devices.\nFor example, there was news this week that regulators are investigating Tesla's recently introduced automated Smart Summon feature, which allows drivers to remotely wave their car in a parking lot. Following the official rollout of the feature last week, a number of users have posted online videos showing crashes, near misses and general comedies. So, @elonmusk \u2013 My first Smart Summon test did not go that well. @Tesla #Tesla # Model3 pic.twitter.com/yC1oBWdq1I\n\u2013 Roddy Hasan \u2013 \u0631\u0627\u0636\u064a (@eiddor) September 28, 2019 [DassollnichtdenenormenFortschrittenderautonomenAutoherstellerdenGarausmachenabereszeigtdassdererbitterteKampfselbstfahrendeFahrzeugeaufdenMarktzubringenmanchmalzuhalbgebackenenProduktenf\u00fchrenkanndievielleichtnochnichtganzfertigsind\u00f6ffentlicherKonsum[19659005] Crossroads\nGrowing tensions between consumers, businesses, governments and academia on the impact of AI technology on society are palpable. Given that the technology industry rates innovation and speed in iterative testing at a slower pace, there is a risk that things will get out of control \u2013 the pursuit of being \"first\" or making lucrative contracts and keeping shareholders happy , could be too tempting.\nAll major companies, from Facebook to Amazon and Google, to Apple, Microsoft and Uber, compete on multiple lines of business, with AI a common theme. There has been a concerted effort to absorb the best AI talents, either by starting out or by hiring the best minds from the best universities. And then there's the problem of insuring high profile customers \u2013 Amazon and Microsoft are currently closing their horns to win a $ 10 billion Pentagon contract for providing AI and cloud services.\nAmidst all this, tech companies are under increasing pressure to provide facial recognition services to the government and law enforcement agencies. Already in January, a coalition of more than 85 stakeholders wrote an open letter to Google, Microsoft and Amazon urging them to stop selling facial recognition software to authorities \u2013 before it's too late.\n\"Businesses can not continue to act as if the\" break then fix \"approach works,\" said Nicole Ozer, director of technology and civil liberties at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in California. \"History has clearly taught us that the government will use technologies such as face tracking to target audiences of black people, religious minorities and immigrants. We are at a crossroads of face surveillance, and the decisions made by these companies will now decide whether the next generation will fear being persecuted by the government to attend a protest, go to their place of worship, or just their lives to live. \"\nThen, in April, two dozen AI science and science researchers called on Amazon to stop selling its recognition software to law enforcement agencies, according to the researchers, the core of the problem was that there was not enough regulation, to control the use of the technology. Above: One illustration shows the support of Amazon Rekognition for detecting faces in crowds.\nAmazon\n\"We urge Amazon to sell the recognition Law enforcement and preventive measures to prevent abuse are not available, \"it said.\" There are no laws or mandatory standards to ensure that detection is used in a way that does not interfere with civil liberties. \"[19659002] Later, however, Amazon announced that they each federal direction would serve with facial recognition technology. as long as it is legal.\nNor is this controversy limited to the US \u2013 it is a global problem that countries and businesses face everywhere. London's King's Cross made headlines in August, when it turned out that facial recognition technology was being used in CCTV security cameras, leading not only to ethical but also legal issues. A separate report also revealed that the local police had submitted photos of seven people for use in conjunction with King's Cross's face recognition system, which was released yesterday.\nAll these examples support the AI \u200b\u200bdevelopment argument. This outstrips the ability of the company to implement appropriate control mechanisms. Pushback\nDigital technology has often evolved too fast for regulation or external control to keep up, but we now see significant regulatory pushbacks \u2013 especially with regard to data protection. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which is due to enter into force on January 1, 2020, seeks to improve consumer privacy rights across the state, and Europe is reviewing a new privacy regulation on electronic communications that governs individuals' privacy on electronic communication.\nHowever, the most recent regulatory advance in recent years has been the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which sets out all sorts of rules on how companies should manage and protect their customers' data. As Google discovered earlier this year with a fine of 50 million euros (57 million US dollars) from the French data protection authority CNIL because of \"lack of transparency\" in terms of personalization of ads, huge fines are waiting for any company that opposes GDPR contrary.

However, there are a number of small but significant updates that slip under the radar. Here's a round up of some of the announcements that will possibly have an impact on your digital life. \u200bGlass That Survives 15 Drops 26 Jul, 2018 Almost every smartphone user knows about Corning's Gorilla Glass \u2014 chemically strengthened glass that is used for protection on the front and even on the rear of some phones. This is tough to do because this glass also has to be optically perfect \u2014 any small imperfections will be visible.Corning just announced the latest version called Gorilla Glass 6 which they claim can survive multiple drops without breaking. They also say it is twice as strong as Gorilla Glass 5 with enhanced scratch resistance to boot. It will not exactly be shatterproof but you can expect your smartphone to be able to withstand a few drops before the glass breaks. The glass is already in production so you can expect premium devices to get this added protection within the next few months.(Image: corning.com) Truecaller Informs, Blocks & Now Records Too 26 Jul, 2018 Call recording is one of the most requested features in a smartphone. Some smartphones have this feature built in (which is ideal) and there are some paid apps that offer it (performance varies across devices). Truecaller has come to the rescue by adding call recording option to the latest update. Note that call recording is only available for Android phones. Tap on the profile icon on top left corner to access the menu and you will see the recording option. A floating button appears when the call is connected and a simple tap starts recording the conversation. Recordings are saved directly to your phone's internal storage and not on the cloud.

He sounded exasperated.\n\"Everyone has been deaf, dumb, and blind moving to the cloud. They think it's safe, convenient, easy\u2014that they've moved to the happy place,\" Eades told me. The point he stressed: Even after a company taps into the cloud\u2014that buzzy nickname for the remotely managed computing resources offered by the likes of Amazon , Microsoft , Google , and others\u2014it retains responsibilities. IT professionals cannot wipe their hands of infrastructure upkeep concerns completely.\nFollowing that call, I wrote a piece for the latest issue of Fortune , published online this morning, which asks, \" After the Capital One Breach, Should Big Business Fear the Public Cloud? \" Generally, as just about every cybersecurity expert I spoke to underscored, the answer is, No.\nThe advantages of the cloud are simply too compelling. Businesses can tap the on demand storage and computing resources they need when they need, thereby reducing waste. Dedicated, crack teams take care of most patching and software updates. The cloud is undeniably convenient and, more importantly, better in terms of security than what the majority of companies can achieve alone.\nDon't take it from me\u2014take it from a practitioner. \"People have been suggesting that there's something inherently bad about cloud infrastructure and I, frankly, think it's just the opposite,\" Edward Amoroso, the former chief security officer of AT&T , told me. (The telecom giant, it must be noted, knows a thing or two about managing complex IT systems.)\nEven Capital One attributes its ability to recover quickly from its breach to its embracement of the cloud. As Sie Soheili, a Capital One spokesperson, emphasized in bolded text in an email to me: \" The speed with which we were able to diagnose and fix this vulnerability, and determine its effect, was enabled by our cloud operating model.\"\nI wondered, upon reading that statement, whether Capital One had no other choice but to double down on a cloud endorsement, given how far down the rabbit hole it has ventured since it began its IT migration five years ago. (On an earnings call earlier this year, CEO Richard Fairbank said he planned to eliminate the last of the bank's data centers in favor of the cloud by 2020.) But even that default posture of journalistic skepticism cannot counter the truth: Moving some portion of one's operations to the cloud is no cybersecurity panacea, but it is, in most cases, an obvious boon.\nRobert Hackett | @rhhackett | robert.hackett@fortune.com\nTHREATS Privacy gaslighting. Two Princeton professors are taking Google to task for suggesting that blocking \"cookies,\" web browser based ID tags, will harm people's privacy. Google argues the move will encourage \"fingerprinting,\" a more persistent and invasive form of tracking. The professors counter that Google is being disingenuous; as they write, \"it is unlikely that Google can provide meaningful web privacy while protecting its business interests, and Chrome continues to fall far behind Safari and Firefox.\"\nRansomware opolis. Municipalities across America are getting ravaged by ransomware attacks, most recently a couple dozen cities in Texas. Hackers pick these targets assuming the cash strapped local governments don't have the resources to keep their systems up to date and protected, as the New York Times writes. The cities have shown a willingness to pay up to in order to get services back up and running.\nTaking care of business. There were a few big business moves in the cybersecurity industry this week. VMware bought Carbon Black , a computer protection software maker, plus Pivotal, a data analytics startup, for a combined $4.8 billion.

And Ping Identity, maker of identity management software, filed for a $100 million initial public offering on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n5Gotham.

Everywhere you look, states, political actors, and troll farms are exploiting Internet tools to spread disinformation, propaganda, and, ultimately, influence. As Sophia Ignatidou, a Catham House fellow, writes for The Guardian , baddies are ramping up their abuse of data mining to hijack minds and behaviors. \"We may soon be dealing not just with disinformation or communications blackouts, but with mass scale surreptitious manipulation through nudging,\" she warns.\nCommunication has been weaponised, used to provoke, mislead and influence the public in numerous insidious ways. Disinformation was just the first stage of an evolving trend of using information to subvert democracy, confuse rival states, define the narrative and control public opinion. Using the large, unregulated, open environments that tech companies once promised would \"empower\" ordinary people, disinformation has spread rapidly across the globe. The power that tech companies offered us has become a priceless tool in propagandists' hands, who were right in thinking that a confused, rapidly globalising world is more vulnerable to the malleable beast of disinformation than straightforward propaganda. Whatever we do, however many fact checking initiatives we undertake, disinformation shows no sign of abating.

While Google is set to reveal all the details of its Stadia service at its own Stadia Connect event today, Microsoft will likely take the announcement of its own service to its Xbox E3 press conference scheduled on 10 June. Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, discusses the Xbox One family of devices. Image: Microsoft.\nMicrosoft has a lot on its plate this year with announcements across games, software, and hardware at E3 2019. However, the most interesting to us is its cloud streaming service Project xCloud. Absolutely nothing was known about the service until now, whether it's about the pricing or how powerful it's going to be. Microsoft has been talking about it for more than a year but there hasn't been any official reveal about the service. However, at E3 20190, that might change.\nAccording to a speculative piece by Thurrott on Microsoft's E3 plans, Project xCloud is supposedly more powerful than Google Stadia. \"While I don't think Microsoft will share the raw performance figures of xCloud, I have heard that it does best Google's previously announced 10.7 teraflops,\" said the report.\nThe report goes on to mention that a live demo of xCloud was also a part of the plan for the press conference. In the demo, a remote location away from the venue will be used to showcase someone using xCloud from their home.\nSony had recently announced a partnership with Microsoft for a cloud streaming service as well. Sony's version will take advantage of Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, which means that Microsoft could potentially be host to two of the largest gaming platforms in the world.\nMany leaks have been doing the rounds since a few months and the list of games includes Halo: Infinite , Gears 5 , Age of Empires IV and a new Fable game. This year, Xbox is the only console that will be present at E3 since Sony has backed out from presenting anything. Although we might not get a full reveal of the next generation of Xbox gaming consoles, the company could share details about its performance bump and a few highlighted features.\nTech2 is now on WhatsApp. For all the buzz on the latest tech and science, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

And people were saying nothing to worry about, Google can't break into gaming. this means a lot less than you're implying MS titles coming to PS5 via streaming? Could it be? :O So gaming, AI and semiconductors (image sensors), interesting #21 Makes sense. Kind of like how Apple buys assets from Samsung to build their devices. They buy shit from their rivals. Google is clutching her pearls now! Collaboration to compete with Stadia? Sony just shot themselves in the foot... Ok, this stopped me in my tracks, I was out the door for lunch. Can we stop fighting now? MS is making some really interesting moves and im totally down to see where it leads. MS have the better infrastructure, Sony have a streaming service that a lot of people actually use. Seems like a reasonable pairing. A mod can edit if they want, I just used the title of the Microsoft article. I added the cloud stuff to the OP as well, thanks! More like what works for Nintendo works for them. I like a good twist. Everyone thought it would begin with Skynet but this is how it really starts. I'm getting flashbacks to Astro Boy Omega Factor having splash screens for Nintendo, Sega and Sony Perfectly encapsulated my reaction reading the OP woah, this is really intersting! wonder how this works out. So focused on Azure to use it for PSNow? #43 Sounds like Sony will be using Microsoft's cloud base for any streaming efforts next gen. Which makes them no different from countless other major corporations that use Microsoft's products and services. It is potentially interesting that they're being so public about this partnership, and I wonder if it's part of a larger effort to combat Google & Stadia by working together instead of competing with each other. If Microsoft makes Sony's streaming tech better, that's sending fewer customers to Google.

It is an open world game where players can choose between three characters and complete missions from their overlapping storylines. In a recent interview, the president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, Jim Ryan said that they have negotiated a deal with Rockstar Games under which they have purchased rights to stream GTA 5 from PlayStation Now. What is PlayStation Now?\nPlayStation Now is Sony's subscription based cloud gaming service. Using PlayStation Now, gamers can play PS2, PS3, and PS4 titles from PC, as well as PlayStation 4. Players don't have to buy or download games with PS Now since it is a cloud gaming service. PlayStation Now currently provides unlimited access to over 660 PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 game titles under its subscription plan. GTA 5 on PlayStation Now\nDue to the growing competition from Google's Stadia and Xbox Gaming Pass, the subscription prices for PlayStation Now were reduced and Sony is now looking for big game titles like GTA 5 to make their service more desirable to gamers.\nWe don't know if Sony owns the exclusive rights to streaming GTA 5 but Jim Ryan, CEO of SIE said in an interview that GTA 5 will stream only on PlayStation Now \"to the best of my knowledge.\" He also said that the deal was good for Rockstar which means that Sony offered a considerable amount for the rights to stream GTA 5 through PS Now. Competition from other Subscription Based Gaming Services\nWhatever the terms of their deal may be, it is clear that Sony is making big moves to make its subscription gaming service stand out among competitors like Xbox Game Pass and Google Stadia. Rockstar Games was also announced as a partner for Google Stadia but there aren't any games that are announced yet. As the deal isn't exclusive officially, Rockstar may allow GTA 5 on other subscription gaming services too.\nMicrosoft will also start public testing of its xCloud streaming service for video games this month. We don't know which titles will be available on the xCloud yet. Google Stadia currently has partnered with game developers like Rockstar Games, Capcom, and EA. But they haven't announced their titles for Google Stadia yet. We will get to know more about the titles when it officially launches next month.

It's a streaming platform, so instead of having to buy a physical copy or download massive files, people can play games that are run on servers at Google's data centers.\nThe news could spur Microsoft on to reveal more about its own streaming service, Project xCloud. The company has long been a household name in the E3 lineup, alongside Sony \u2014 although interestingly, the latter isn't showing up at this year's event.\n\"Cloud gaming will be front and center of many discussions at E3 as the industry adapts to the changing business models,\" Candice Mudrick, head of analysis at industry research group Newzoo, told CNBC by email.\n\"Microsoft and Google are the main ones to watch for, and Stadia has already released details on its service ahead of E3.\"\nThe ability to jump into a game from a computer or tablet could prove appealing for gamers. At the Stadia demo earlier this year, the company said a player could watch a video of a game on YouTube and click a button that lets gamers play it in as fast as five seconds.\n'Disrupt the console gaming ecosystem' Google said Thursday that the service would cost about $10 per month, while the controller used to play it will cost around $70. It will only come with 30 games from major publishers including Electronic Arts, Warner Bros., 2K and Sega, with just two being Stadia exclusives. It's set to launch in November this year.\nA prominent lack of exclusives could be a challenge for the Silicon Valley titan, as Microsoft's E3 lineup is expected to include blockbuster Xbox only titles including \"Halo Infinite\" and \"Gears 5.\"\n\"In our view, Google's service has the potential to disrupt the console gaming ecosystem that has been dominated by Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony for decades,\" analysts at Wedbush said in a recent note. However, they added that Stadia's business model and third party support remained \"key question marks.\"\nFollowing the initial announcement of Google Stadia, Sony announced a partnership with Microsoft that sees the Japanese tech giant using the latter's Azure cloud service for streaming games and media.\nWedbush analysts said the Sony Microsoft deal was \"driven in part\" by Google's game streaming service. Microsoft could get the upper hand, though, given Sony has decided not to attend this year's expo.\nMichael Patcher, managing director of equity research at Wedbush, told CNBC Sony's decision not to join this year's E3 was a \"mistake\" as the cost of hosting a press conference at the show is \"minor in comparison to the publicity they receive.\"\nMicrosoft could, therefore, take the spotlight given its biggest hardware competitor won't grab anywhere near the same level of publicity.\nThe company is also expected to announce details on its upcoming next generation console. With Sony skipping 2019's E3, Microsoft could use it as an opportunity to reveal more information on the next Xbox. Sony did, however, announce some new details about the next PlayStation console on Thursday.\nNevertheless, streaming could prove a headline generator at E3 2019. According to Newzoo's Mudrick, this could be Microsoft's opportunity to latch onto the streaming phenomenon.\n\"Given Stadia's reveal today without \"killer app\" games that are must haves for ultimate gamers, there is opportunity for Microsoft to swoop in,\" she said.", "URL": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-apos-streaming-platform-could-141352811.html"}, {"Title": "How Sony bought, and squandered, the future of cloud gaming", "Text": "Stop me if you've heard this one before: a video game platform that lets you play games with the press of a button, no need for discs or downloads.

Ask a friend to take over your controller from across the internet.\nIf that sounds like the lofty pitch for Google's Stadia cloud gaming service , you've been paying attention. But every single one of those things was promised years ago by a startup named Gaikai \u2014 a startup that Sony bought in 2012 for $380 million. At the time, Sony gave every indication that it would harness the full potential of a PlayStation cloud. It even bought Gaikai's closest competitor, OnLive , in 2015 and launched a service called PlayStation Now that finally hit 1 million subscribers in October. But half a decade later, the company has barely tapped into cloud gaming's promise, and competitors like Google seem poised to attract the gamers that Sony failed to convert.\nI doubt it's a coincidence that Google and Gaikai's pitches sound so similar. As Gaikai co founder, CEO, and former PlayStation Now chief David Perry pointed out to me in an interview on the day Stadia debuted, Google gaming boss Phil Harrison used to sit on Gaikai's advisory board. Jack Buser, Stadia's head of business development, used to run Sony's PlayStation Now. Heck, a clean shaven Sundar Pichai was the one who first introduced how Gaikai could stream games natively in the Chrome web browser three years before he became Google's CEO.\nRelated\nGoogle Stadia review: the best of cloud gaming is still just a beta The world is waiting for Google Stadia to flop Mind you, Google is already having plenty of trouble meeting the lofty goals it cribbed from Gaikai, breaking many of the promises it made before launch. But how did Sony let Google become the front runner in cloud gaming to begin with, after having the better part of a decade to freely build it out?\nLet's take a quick trip back to February 2013 when Sony introduced the PlayStation 4 and revealed Gaikai's newfound role in the whole thing. When Perry strode onstage, he presented a vision of a PlayStation Network like we'd never seen before, one that would let you instantly try any game before you buy it. His words:\nWith the Gaikai cloud technology, our goal is to make free exploration possible for virtually any PlayStation 4 game in the PlayStation Store. Imagine you're in the store, checking out the latest titles and you see something that catches your eye: no problem. You can simply press the X button to hop in and start playing the game. Now in the past, not all games were available, and the ones that were had to be kind of the 'lite' version, where they'd been edited down so they could be downloaded reasonably quickly. With Gaikai and the PlayStation Store, you'll be able to instantly experience anything that you want. I've always liked that concept of try it for free, share it if you like it, and pay only for the games you fall in love with.\nIt's easy to forget this was Gaikai's pitch from the start: instant free demos of games you can try before you buy, using practically any device you own.\nI got an exclusive first look at Gaikai in December 2010, and I'll never forget what Perry asked me afterward: not whether the streaming quality was good, but if I'd experienced enough to figure out whether the game was worth buying. That was why Gaikai originally streamed games from YouTube and Facebook ads \u2014 they were legitimately ads! \u2014 though Gaikai was also willing to let publishers stand up their own servers and set their own pricing if gamers wanted to turn those ads into game time.\nWhen I visited Gaikai's headquarters in June 2012, I was amazed by how many endpoints Gaikai had already built. Both LG and Samsung TVs were slated to feature the service. It worked with an off the shelf Android tablet. Best Buy and Walmart had live game demos you could play on their websites, and you could share demos on Facebook with your friends and relatives if you liked.\nBut Perry says most of that went out the window when he cashed Sony's check. \"After Sony acquired Gaikai, we went quiet. I stopped giving speeches, I stopped pushing this as the future of the industry... We withdrew from all the deals,\" he relates.\nThough Perry says he's loyal to Sony for buying Gaikai and eventually building a service with 1 million subscribers instead of just \"shoving it somewhere in a drawer,\" he says his personal opinion is that Sony didn't really understand what to do with Gaikai, and he started by trying to shoehorn Gaikai's tech into a way to sell its own hardware.\n\"Sony acquired something that they thought would be a good idea to buy because they could feel the momentum, and I don't think at the time it was clear to them which business they were in,\" Perry says. \"If you are in charge of PlayStation, are you in the hardware business or are you in the gameplay business? I don't think that was clear. Because if you're in the hardware business, this isn't very interesting. If you're the guys building hardware, and someone starts talking about the cloud, it's just like, 'Meh, we've got work to do.'\"\nAnd \"meh\" was definitely how I felt when Sony's PlayStation Now cloud gaming service debuted. When an open beta launched in late 2014, it was ridiculed as the antiquated Blockbuster of video games : a service where you'd have to rent each PS3 title \u2014 and only PS3 titles \u2014 for more than you'd pay to buy a used disc at GameStop. It felt like an expensive way to cover for the fact that the PS4 wasn't backwards compatible with PS3 games.\nSony later added a $20 a month subscription service for a selection of less desirable games alongside the rentals (it eventually ditched rentals altogether), and it expanded support to the PS3, PS Vita, PlayStation TV, a handful of Sony TVs and Blu ray players, and even a few Samsung smart TVs.\nBut it took until late 2016 for Sony to finally let you play PlayStation games on a PC , and it was mid 2017 before it added a back catalog of current gen PS4 titles instead of exclusively older games. And it was tough luck if you wanted to play those PS4 games on your Sony handheld or smart TV because Sony ditched every other platform , save PC and PS4, along the way. It was just last month when Sony finally dropped the price of PlayStation Now to a more reasonable $60 a year and deigned to add a few flagship games like God of War and Uncharted 4. But even those $20 \"greatest hits\" games will only be available to stream through January 2nd, 2020.\nEven though Sony has finally stopped trying to use its PS4 Remote Play app to sell Sony smartphones, and it opened it up to iPhone and Android gamers (years after shutting down a perfectly good hack ), there's no parallel PlayStation Now mobile app in sight. Sony completely ceded the Gaikai / OnLive era idea of delivering cloud games directly to phones. That's where Microsoft's xCloud is now striking first and where Google and early Gaikai partner Nvidia may also have an opportunity.\nThere are reasons why Sony took it slow with Gaikai \u2014 they're just unfortunate reasons \u2014 like how Sony's initial PlayStation Now service relied on having actual PS3 hardware in the data center for every single player. That capped Sony's physical and economic ability to expand the service as quickly as it might have liked. Or how the company wound up diverting its attention to VR.\n\"VR took all the air in the room for a while.\" \"Cloud gaming is working. We've demonstrated it. We're sort of waiting for things to get better and have more power in the cloud, faster internet speeds, all the rest of it... And then VR comes out, and VR took all the air in the room for a while,\" says Perry. He also points out that Sony never put much marketing behind PS Now or ran a real ad until last month. Sony also never wound up offering a bundle with its other subscription services like PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Vue, for that matter.\nWhen I ask Perry what happened to the key part of his original vision \u2014 the idea that PS4 players would be able to instantly sample games for free \u2014 he admits that Sony never actually tried.\n\"It was something I was passionate about, but I don't think it had the support of others,\" says Perry, adding that he found it wasn't necessarily compatible with \"the harsh reality of business.\" One example: he spoke to a publisher who told him, \"David, we don't want anyone to play our game.\" When Perry asked why, he says they replied: \"Because the trailer does a better job of convincing them our game is good. The game isn't very good to be honest, but the trailer makes it look good.\" It was a clarifying moment.\n\"We don't want anyone to play our game.\" Even so, Perry says he believes gamers would \"have to be insane not to sign up\" for PlayStation Now at the new lower price, as long as they spend a lot of time gaming. \"The amount of games you're getting for the money is absurd.\" But he also believes that Sony, Google, and other prospective cloud gaming providers need to stop trying to stick existing gaming components into their servers and convince publishers to build and share their best games instead of just a back catalog of titles. \"They have to decide that this is the future.\"\nPerry's somewhat worried that cloud gaming will adopt the same pattern we're seeing with other streaming media today , where Disney and HBO and Apple and many more are all standing up their own video delivery services to compete with Netflix for our attention. \"When things get out of control, you end up with multiple streaming services. And you want to watch Harry Potter, and you don't know where it is,\" he says. Sony had seven unchallenged years to convince publishers, but now Google, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Microsoft, Nintendo, Amazon, Verizon, Walmart, Nvidia, and others are all testing the waters for their own possible cloud gaming subscriptions.\nNone of this is to say Sony wasted those seven years or made the wrong decisions. The PlayStation 4 wound up becoming a phenomenal success. It's the second best selling console of all time having shipped over 102 million units, handily winning this console generation. PlayStation VR is also one of the best selling console accessories ever , even if VR hasn't taken off quite yet. And Sony did need to make some hard choices during the past decade to turn around its foundering business. This is the decade Sony decided it was no longer an electronics company , chopping off pieces of itself to survive.\nSome of Gaikai's know how might have even been responsible for that success. In 2012, Gaikai showed me a demo where you could start playing a game while the rest of it downloads in the background \u2014 something that became a core feature of the PlayStation 4. Share Play, a feature that lets you see a friend's screen from over the internet and then take over the controls, also eventually shipped. But even if Sony doesn't become a front runner in cloud gaming, buying Gaikai and OnLive early on means it has a lot of patents on the tech.\nWhen I try it again for the first time in years, I have to admit PlayStation Now isn't bad. I'm streaming God of War on my Windows desktop at a fairly lackluster 720p resolution, but with nary a hitch. There's no way I'd spend $10 a month or $60 a year for that experience \u2014 not when I can own those same games permanently for $10 or less per disc \u2014 but I would pay if Sony gave me the latest games there. Better yet, I'd pay to get games that aren't even possible on console, with hundreds or thousands of simultaneous players, incredibly advanced physics simulations, and AI voiced NPCs that don't just repeat the same pre programmed lines of dialogue. It's not clear whether Sony has any intent to do so \u2014 and now it'll have to fight its own ideas in the hands of much wealthier adversaries like Google. All we know for sure is that the PlayStation 5 is coming, and Sony has a vague interest in maximizing the \"off console opportunity\" of cloud gaming as well.\nIn 2014, Perry claimed that Sony had \"fully greenlit\" a project where Gaikai would help build \"the fastest global network ever made\" to let gamers play like never before. That may still be the plan, but Sony's going to need some help. That may be why it struck a cloud gaming partnership with Microsoft this May, teaming up with its chief rival.\nSony was one of the few companies that believed in cloud gaming enough to spend big in 2012, just as it was one of the few that believed in VR. But that wasn't enough to make Sony a leader.\nRelated\nMicrosoft and Sony are teaming up for the future of gaming\nPlayStation 25th anniversary issue Hardware 4 How the PlayStation's DualShock shaped modern controllers The rise and fall of the PlayStation supercomputers Remember how simple consoles used to be with this original PlayStation teardown The portable PlayStations were Sony at its most ambitious Games and culture 6 One of PlayStation's most important studios makes games about loneliness Naughty Dog's president on how games changed since the first PlayStation: 'They're barely recognizable' How to play classic PlayStation games in 2019 Why Final Fantasy became the face of Sony's first PlayStation How the PlayStation logo became a streetwear icon The PlayStation 3 was Blu ray's ultimate Trojan horse", "URL": "https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"}]}, {"client": "WALMART | GB000QCY", "industry": "Retail", "segment": "Industry", "intensity": 291.0, "market": "US", "products": "Google Cloud Dataproc, Google Cloud Dataflow", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Strong", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "EMC CORPORATION | GB000S1M", "industry": "Electronics", "segment": "Commercial", "intensity": 191.0, "market": "US", "products": "Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud Platform", "score": 30.0, "relationshipStrength": "Strong", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": [{"Title": "Q&A- Dell EMC, VMware partnership continues to evolve in cloud market", "Text": "UPDATED 23:13 EDT / MAY 24 2019 CLOUD by Nick Marinoff SHARE\nNot every cloud provider is equal. Some providers offer certain technical aspects or software programs that others don't. They may work with different kinds of customers and incorporate different methods for helping those customers to stay efficient.\nDell EMC and VMware Inc. partner to give customers the latest upgrades in the cloud space. Both companies have discovered that collaborating and integrating cloud technology changes into their own operations help them to better understand customers' needs and mindsets, according to Varun Chhabra (pictured, left), vice president of product marketing, Dell EMC cloud platform, at Dell Technologies Inc., and Muneyb Minhazuddin (pictured, right), vice president of product marketing \u2014 cloud, security and workspace solutions \u2014 at VMware Inc.\nChhabra and Minhazuddin spoke with Rebecca Knight ( @knightrm ) and Stu Miniman ( @stu ), co hosts of theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media's mobile livestreaming studio, during the Dell Technologies World event in Las Vegas. They discussed what Dell can provide that other cloud providers can't, the kinds of customers both companies are working with, and how VMware is looking to bring more cloud based applications to customers (see the full interview with transcript here ). (* Disclosure below.)\n[Editor's note: The following answers have been condensed for clarity.]\nMiniman: Let's talk about that public cloud. We know VMware Cloud on AWS sent ripples through the industry \u2014 and the Google Cloud piece. So tell us what's new. Anything different about the Microsoft piece when it becomes a public cloud, and how does that fit within relation to all the other clouds?\nMinhazuddin: We think about customers' choices first. You've got multiple cloud providers. Why are customers going towards the multicloud world? Because applications are going there. VMware's strategy has been to say, \"How do we empower customers with that choice?\" Our AW S partnership is as strong as ever. We continue to innovate there. That was our first choice of platform. We have 4,000 cloud provider partners. They're not small names. They include IBM. They've got Rackspace and some of the biggest cloud providers.\nSo, how do we take our stack and land it in as many public clouds as possible? We took the first step of IBM, then about 4,000 other cloud providers, be it Rackspace , Fujitsu or Hitachi. Then came Amazon, Amazon being the choice of destination for a lot of public clouds. Today, we further extend that with Microsoft , and with Google a few weeks ago, so this is about customers' choices when they want the hybrid multicloud piece. It is app driven. They want this in multiple places.\nKnight: Can you talk about customers you're working with? You don't need to name names, but just how you are enabling those people to be more productive or more collaborative and to get their jobs done?\nChhabra: We have large banks that are standardizing their workloads on VMware today, as have many more organizations, and they're looking for the flexibility to be able to move stuff to the cloud or move it back on premises and not have to reformat. They don't have to change their machine formats. This makes it easy.\nThey want the flexibility to be able to run applications in their bank branches in the cloud, but they don't necessarily want to adopt a new machine format or a new standardized platform. We can now move workloads seamlessly to Azure by using vCenter or other tools that you're familiar with today to be able to provision your workloads.\nMiniman: There are lots of incentives to getting customers onto VMware, but often they're N minus one, two or something like that. How do we manage and make sure that VMware is more cloud like and up to date?\nChhabra: There are two ways to do that. One of them is, because the VMware and Dell EMC teams are working on engineering closely together, we're going to have the latest version supported right out of the gate, so you have an update that's going to work on your hardware or vice versa. That's one level.\nWith VMware Cloud or Dell EMC, we're also providing the ability to basically have hands off management and have that infrastructure run in your data center or your edge locations, but at the same time not have to manage it. You leave that management to Dell Technologies and to VMware to be able to manage that solution for you. We're bringing that public cloud experience to your on premise locations as well.\nWatch the complete video interview below, and be sure to check out more of SiliconANGLE's and theCUBE's coverage of the Dell Technologies World 2019 event.

It's been a long week for us on the team (never move apartments, is all I'm saying). We'll get into more of that right away.\nBut first: New to the newsletter? You can sign up here.\nOn Monday afternoon, The Wall Street Journal broke the news that Ascension, the second largest health system in the US is working with Google. The endeavor, called \"Project Nightingale\", involves data on millions of patients, that could be accessed by Ascension employees as well as close to 150 Google employees , and patients weren't notified about the project.\nShortly after The Journal's report, Ascension came out with a statement acknowledging the work, detailing the scope of the work the two are doing together \u2013 including moving patient records onto the cloud, as well as exploring ways to develop AI tools.\nAs it turns out, this was something my UK based colleague Alexandra Ma had on her radar already. She got her hands on a whole bunch of documents related to the so called \"Project Nightingale.\" Together, we sifted through them to bring you an inside look into what Google and Ascension are up to.\nGoogle is working with a massive health system to gather data on millions of patients. Here's an inside look at the tools they're developing.\nSince then, the US Department of Health and Human Services has said it's seeking more information on the partnership, and a number of US senators have spoken out about the project.\nThe big question coming out of this doesn't seem to be about whether the arrangement was or wasn't HIPAA compliant. It's more that tech companies are increasingly going to have a hand in what's going on with our health data. Are we comfortable with that? Let me know your thoughts \u2013 lramsey@businessinsider.com.\nIn other tech giant news, Apple's 400,000 person Apple Watch study results are in. Erin Brodwin has the breakdown of what we learned. For me, the biggest takeaway was how many people didn't follow through.\nAn unprecedented study suggests the Apple Watch can help detect heart problems. But very few people actually used it to do that. And Erin spoke to more than half a dozen former employees at a vertical farming startup. Some told her about times they felt unsafe at work.\nA futuristic farming startup raised $260 million from Jeff Bezos and SoftBank on the promise of upending agriculture. Insiders are raising questions. And on that note, today is Erin's last day at BI. Erin's been such a big part of the team and we wish her well at her next opportunity. She's been at BI for five years , during which time I had the privilege to work with her first as my editor (thanks for hiring me, Erin!) and later as a reporting colleague.\nWe're excited to see what she gets up to next (I'll let her give you all the details!).\n'It's time for another evolution' Monday may have been consumed by the Google Ascension news, but the news cycle also brought a report that KKR has made a formal offer to Walgreens regarding going private.\nSince last week , our wheels have been turning trying to make sense of the implications of the retail pharmacy giant going private.\nGoing private could give Walgreens the relief from quarterly earnings it needs to adapt. But either way, it seems clear that in the future the retail pharmacy won't look like how it looks today.\nIn a conversation after earnings last week, when I asked CVS CEO Larry Merlo about this, he told me, \"It's time for another evolution. We see us leading that evolution with what we're doing, with our strategy and the drug store becoming more of a health destination.\"\nI broke down the approaches Walgreens and CVS are taking and the challenges that lie within each plan here:\nWalgreens and CVS have dueling visions for the future of pharmacies. Here are the biggest obstacles each one faces.\nFor those companies actively going deeper in healthcare, there's a potential to disrupt the usual flow of business for health systems who stand to lose out on key referrals if patients start at a retailer rather than a primary care doctor in their system. Are health systems prepared for that? I take a closer look at that here.\nCVS and Walmart are beefing up their healthcare strategies as they take on Amazon. Here's what that means for the rest of the healthcare industry.\nData, data, data It's not just Google looking to bring its AI skills to healthcare. Clarrie Feinstein broke down the investments in AI companies that together totaled $1 billion.\nInvestors just poured more than $1 billion into startups using AI to tackle every part of healthcare.

Pacemakers, vehicles, and appliances are all at risk of being hacked at home and abroad. Panelists discuss the national security risks posed by corruption of IoT devices and ways to mitigate the probability of successful attacks.\nTIMBERG: All right. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to today's Council on Foreign Relations meeting on hacking and the Internet of Things. We have a distinguished panel with us here today. I'm Craig Timberg. I'm the national technology reporter at the Washington Post. I've been covering privacy, security, and what I think of as technology behaving badly since 2012. And I've come to learn that when conversations involve the word \"internet\" and \"security,\" they tend not to go that well for everybody. So I can't promise this will be uplifting, but I can promise that we will try to make it spirited and illuminating.\nAnd in pursuit of that, I want to introduce the people to my right. Starting right here, this is Rob Knake. He's a former White House cybersecurity official. He's now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. This is Niloofar Razi Howe. Did I get it?\nHOWE: Perfect.\nTIMBERG: Right. I'm told she will answer to Niloo. She is the\u2014\nHOWE: (Laughs.) Anything you call me.\nTIMBERG: Yeah, yeah. She is the former chief global strategy officer at RSA Security. She's also worked in various parts of the government and corporate world. And she can talk about national security issues, as I guess all of them can. And then Beau Woods, on the far, is the cybersecurity innovation fellow at the Atlantic Council. And he has some expertise in energy systems and transportation systems. And so we'll try to move broadly through a lot of subjects.\nBut first, I want to allow each of them just to introduce themselves for a minute or two, and just tell us what's on your mind as we start this conversation.\nKNAKE: Sure.\nTIMBERG: Let me start with you, Rob.\nKNAKE: OK. So I'm actually at an optimistic point when it comes to cybersecurity. When I look at the overall trends, I think we're actually heading in the right directions. Things are better than they were ten years ago. Ten years before that, you might not have been able to say that. so overall, we're heading in the right direction. The cloud is actually making us more secure. The iPhone that somebody's picking up and taking a photo of right now\u2014(laughter)\u2014is far more secure than a computing device at NSA in, say, 1995. We're starting to figure out how to do security.\nWhat gives me a moment of pause is IoT, where we have not learned any of the lessons from PCs from the 1990s and applied them today. And it's worse, because there are billions of them, and billions more are growing. So the optimistic part is we actually probably know how to secure these devices. The pessimistic part is, we're not doing it.\nHOWE: So I would love to inject a little bit of optimism and context for the conversation as well. I think when we talk about IoT, Rob's absolutely right in terms of the security threat that it represents. But there's a reason why it's propagating so fast. And it's because of the tremendous benefits that can be driven by IoT. On the low end, we expect in the next few years over $2 trillion of economic benefit, up to double digit amounts of global economic benefit\u2014$11 and $15 trillion of economic benefit\u2014and in a wide variety of sectors, right? Manufacturing, transportation, utilities, agriculture, health care.\nA lot of times the headlines are taken by consumer wearable devices and smart home, but that's actually not where most of the value is going to be driven. Seventy to 80 percent of the value is going to be driven in business to business applications. And when you think about the goodness that creates from a humanistic perspective, it's pretty tremendous. So we're talking about increasing energy efficiency. We're talking about reducing water consumption and fertilizer usage for allowing greater food production as our arable land decreases. We're talking about using augmented reality for physical therapy, for stroke therapy, when people can't get to a place. Augmented reality for parents to be able to interact in the NICU with newborns who are very, very ill and can't have human touch. So the use cases for this are actually pretty tremendous. And that's why everyone gets so excited about IoT.\nThe second part of the context is we're absolutely at the front end of the innovation curve. So this is just starting. And the truth is that, you know, we're just starting to realize what the benefits are going to be. But what we can expect is that the innovation is only going to accelerate. So wherever we sit today, with respect to IoT, and these devices and sensors in the ecosystem, we're just at the starting line. And we can sort of try and imagine where this goes, but we're not entirely positive about it.\nNow, the complicating factor is when we talk about security we're not talking about the sensor or the device. This is actually an ecosystem play. And some people say it's an ecosystem of ecosystem plays, right? So you're talking about the firmware, the software, the cloud storage, the analytics that goes with it from the data that's being created. You're talking about the networking and the communication infrastructure. So that one little device, you can secure it but it won't mean anything if the entire ecosystem is insecure, and if it's not part of a secure ecosystem\u2014broader ecosystem.\nFor example, a European casino was recently hacked through the thermostat in its fish tank, right? So that little thermostat in the fish tank has its own ecosystem that it's a part of, but it's a part of thousands of other devices that create the bigger ecosystem. And that's part of what makes this so complex, is that we're not just talking about securing a desktop or a server, like we were in the '90s. We're actually talking about securing the ecosystem. And the weakest link is going to be where the vulnerability comes in.\nAnother part of the complexity is today the economic benefit for security is pretty low, right? The cost isn't disintermediated. I don't expect my fridge to scam me. But it could be used to take down Netflix. So, you know, the value of security isn't well understood by the consumer and by the end users. And, frankly, the manufacturers don't necessarily have the incentives in place. But the economic benefit of embracing IoT is very well understood. And in fact, McKinsey just put out a report\u2014it happened to arrive in my inbox yesterday\u2014that showed that companies that aggressively pursue IoT applications and pilots tend to drive three times as much drive from IoT than companies that don't. So very little economic incentive to secure, huge economic incentive to embrace. Which kind of brings us to where we are.\nTIMBERG: And, Beau, you want to take a minute?\nWOODS: Sure. So one of the hats that I wear occasionally, when the government is not shutdown, is I'm entrepreneur in residence at the Food and Drug Administration. And in that health care role, I see a lot of people whose lives are absolutely transformed by IoT devices\u2014by infusion pumps, insulin pumps, implanted pacemakers that can connect to the internet and report back to their doctor and let them know when something's going to be coming up. So there's a huge amount of both economic and societal benefit to Internet of Things, if we get it right.\nBut I'm also cognizant that we're becoming over dependent on undependable technology. So over the last five years or so, we've spent globally about a trillion dollars on people, product, services for cybersecurity. And yet, if you measure failure by breaches of corporations, we're failing at about 100 percent rate. Now, I don't think either of those numbers is a good portent for what would happen as we import that technology into systems that we already trust and that we depend on every day.\nSo what happens if the health care industry has an extra trillion dollars stacked on top of it over five years? That's pretty hefty. What happens if the failure rate increases of medical devices because we've basically put undependable things in them? And that's what worries me, is that we won't reach the promise because we get hamstrung by the peril that can come.\nWe are on the front end of this technology curve. And we haven't discovered all the future benefits, like you said. We also have discovered all the future downsides. And I worry that we're in kind of an awkward teenage age with technology, with these technologies in particular, where we are adopting them because we see the promise, we see the benefit, but before we can secure them.\nWhich means we're going to have ten, twenty, thirty years, in some cases, for these devices to live when they are both vulnerable and exposed to adversaries at varying capability levels, even down to the level of I can download a tool, click go, and create a botnet of my own that can do things like take down major corporations, kick them offline. Or use the IoT devices that are connected to infiltrate deeper into the organization. And the same types of technologies that are in a home router are also in medical devices. They're also in cars. They're also in these other things.\nSo essentially we're concentrating risk on a smaller number of undependable components. And doing that by placing them in places where we have to have high reliability. And so I'm also an optimist like everybody else, I think, on the panel.\nTIMBERG: No, I'm not an optimist. (Laughter.)\nWOODS: Oh, good.\nTIMBERG: To become a journalist, we don't come in the optimistic flavor. (Laughter.)\nWOODS: I'm an optimist, but I think I'm only an optimist if we can disseminate the information that we already know about, you know, the few things we know to do right\u2014really right. But more importantly, the many, many things we know to easily fail. And right now, like Rob said, we're not learning the lessons that we already learned in the '90s in PCs and in corporate networks.\nTIMBERG: So let me start with kind of a definitional question. I mean, Internet of Things. It kind of sounds like it could be everything. But you don't actually mean my iPhone, which by a dictionary definition is a thing, or my laptop computer, which by dictionary definition is a thing. So what gets counted as an Internet of Thing? Are we talking about my car, my refrigerator, my insulin pump? How do we characterize this?\nRob, why don't you take a stab at that.\nKNAKE: So this is not an IoT device\u2014(laughter)\u2014but it could be. There are now thermoses that\u2014\nTIMBERG: It will be. When we do this five years from now that an IoT device.\nKNAKE: No, you can go out and buy this from\u2014I think is it an Indiegogo project, or something like that, that is funded\u2014to essentially take a water bottle for hot and cold beverages and maintain its heat at the appropriate temperature and report that data back to you, to your iPhone. So that's\u2014the whole concept is the idea of taking really, really cheap sensors and really, really cheap mobile chips, and using them to put sensors in places we never would have put them before\u2014which has massive benefits if they are inside your heart, or in your artificial limbs. Maybe less so if they are your light bulbs, though I understand Niloo really likes her IoT light bulbs.\nBut that's what we're talking about with the Internet of Things. It's the spreading of sensors and communications technology to places we never would have put it before.\nTIMBERG: But why not my phone, right? Thirty, forty years ago I wouldn't have thought of my phone as having a sensor, so why is the dividing line there? Is it because I have a more direct relationship with it?\nWOODS: Yeah. So there's many ways you can break this up, what's the distinction between those. But I see at least three or four fundamental differences between Internet of Things and traditional computing and networking. That is, consequences are different. So the consequences, if your\u2014if your laptop crashes are very different than if your car crashes because of a security issue, right? The timelines are very different. So on one hand, medical devices will be in hospitals for decades. The average lifespan of a car, I think, is something like eleven years on the road. So they're much, much longer lived.\nOn the other hand, the time scales with which the consequences manifest are much, much shorter. They're more real time. You also have different capabilities that you can\u2014you can bring to bear. So while your laptop today doesn't control the physical work, IoT does. There's some control element of that. And there's also different contexts. So when you're in a corporate environment you've got an IT team that can help with all of the security issues that you have. When you're driving your car down the road or when you're flying a plane through the air, where is the IT team? Where is the support staff? It's basically you, and you're kind of busy doing\u2014\nTIMBERG: I'm hoping that's true with an airplane. I'm hoping I'm not in charge of that.\nWOODS: Well, hopefully you're not in charge of that. But for the pilots and for the doctors in hospitals, and for the other people who are specialists at operating this equipment, they have less computer security training than, obviously, the average IT staff.\nTIMBERG: I see. I'm going to break down everyone's optimism. So how many of these things are part of the Internet of Things? I hear there's more of them than there are of us. Niloo, you want to take a stab?\nHOWE: So there's about seven point six billion humans in the world. We\u2014you know, as of last year there were close to nine billion, you know, Internet of Things. Projected to be\u2014\nTIMBERG: And how many of them are hackable?\nHOWE: \u2014twenty billion. Hundred percent probably are\u2014\nTIMBERG: OK. (Laughs.)\nHOWE: I mean, look, at the end of the day if someone wants to hack something, and they're completely focused on it, they can probably figure out how to get in. But how many of them have any kind of security, any kind of reasonable security\u2014as the California legislation is requiring? Something like six out of seven home routers don't\u2014have outdated firmware. So a large portion of these are not secure\u2014not even not secure by design, but they have known vulnerabilities. I think the projection is that by 2025 the average person's going to have about 4,000 interactions a day with the Internet of Things.\nAnd, you know, the good news is we have a little bit of time here. So when 5G arrives as a communications infrastructure, that's when we have to be really worried, because 5G is going to enable the massive sort of propagation of the Internet of Things because of the particular\u2014because what it enables is faster. It has very low latency, which is what you need for autonomous cars, for example. And it is designed to allow you to attack a lot of things to it, which 4G is not. So it's not around the corner, but we have to have this date in mind, because when 5G gets here, this thing's going to really explode.\nTIMBERG: Right. And so\u2014to go back to the example of my iPhone, which we agree is not really a part of the Internet of Things, but it gets updated every few weeks by Apple. Is that happening with the gazillion Internet of Things things out there?\nWOODS: No.\nTIMBERG: No. (Laughter.) Are any of them getting updated? And why is that a problem, if they're not being updated?\nWOODS: So there's kind of a\u2014many, many links in the chain of why things aren't being updated. And if any one of those breaks, then you don't have an end product that's updated. So you have source component software, little packages in libraries that get pulled into the building of the thing to begin with. You have the manufacturer\u2014the kind of file goods manufacturer who then would have to update that source component from their repository. Then you push it out to a consumer or, in some cases, a middle man that would then have to adopt the update. So if you think about, like, the Android ecosystem. It doesn't matter what Google publishes. It's up to Kyocera to update your handset. Or Kyocera and T Mobile. In some cases, there's a longer chain. And then it's often up to the individual consumer to hit the button that says \"update.\" And even in highly managed environments, like hospitals, somewhere along that chain breaks down. So if you look at home routers, six out of seven are updated. That's really good compared to hospitals and medical devices.\nTIMBERG: OK. So there's more of these things than there are of us. They are not well secured and they're not getting updated with security patches. OK. Now what kinds of actual things have happened in the Internet of Things world? Rob, I know you've written a lot about botnets. Do you want to take a stab at this one?\nKNAKE: Sure. So botnets, right, are networks of computers that have been turned into bots, controlled by a bot master, for malicious purposes. Every kind of malicious purpose you can think of on the internet. Everything for propagating spam to carrying out ransomware attacks, to carrying out distributed denial of service attacks, flooding attacks. Ten years ago usually these were compromised home computers. You didn't update your Windows XP machine, it gets infected. It becomes part of a botnet. And it starts pushing out traffic to, say, take down the website of JPMorgan.\nFast forward to today, most of the botnets we're seeing aren't affecting home computers. They are affecting IoT devices, which are undefended, often directly accessible over the internet, and can be taken over very easily and formed into these very large botnets. The biggest case recently were the 2016 Mirai attacks, which ended up\u2014the Mirai malware was written by just a bunch of\u2014they were Rutgers University students. This was not a science experiment. This was a criminal enterprise. But they were at Rutgers.\nHOWE: And it was Minecraft, right?\nKNAKE: And it was\u2014right. What they were doing was they were actually forming a botnet, so they could take out servers for the computer game Minecraft. This is a very competitive world gaming. And so this actually happens all the time. Most DDoS attacks in the United States, I believe, are actually targeted at gaming servers. So this is the sort of bad effect that I focused on. The things that can happen to your privacy from a botnet are bad to you, from a compromised IoT device, are bad to you. The things that your compromised IoT device can do to the rest of the internet, to major corporations, to everybody else, are where I think we have a real public policy failure. We don't know how to handle the problem that there are bad people doing things to nice computing devices to cause a problem for a third party. And I think that's the biggest public policy challenge in this area.\nTIMBERG: And Niloo, are there any national security implications of this at this point? Or is this all in the future and theoretical?\nHOWE: No, of course there's huge national security implications. I mean, if you think about health care, if you think about the grid, if you think about, again, all these\u2014whether it's DDoSing critical infrastructures, as has happened to financial services institutions, whether it's taking down the grid\u2014there are real national security implications. And there has to be a sort of national conversation from a strategy perspective. But we also can't really wait for that, because I do think that, again, some of this is Groundhog Day , right? Like, you are reliving 1995. No default username and password. At least a smart approach to default username and password. I mean, we talked about this in the 1990s.\nSo there's a lot of lessons that we learned twenty years ago that we really should be able to apply to this situation. I mean, one of the most important to me is we cannot put humans at the center of security posture. If we're relying on people to actually change the passwords, to download, configure, patch, all that stuff, we know we're terrible at this, right? Our operating system is pretty flawed in terms of dealing with this age of rapid innovation. And so we've got to take the human out of the mix. And we have to automate as much of this as possible. That's the end state we need to go to, especially in a world where these things outnumber the people by an order of magnitude, which is where we're headed to.\nSo the lessons are very clearly there. We need to develop a policy. We need to develop a strategy. And from a crawl, walk, run approach, we're not even crawling today. So there's some low hanging fruit that we can\u2014we can implement pretty fast.\nTIMBERG: So we've talked a little bit about the things that have happened so far\u2014the DDoS attacks and such. Beau, if we look out five, ten years\u2014you deal with transportation and energy grids\u2014what could go wrong in five or ten years?\nWOODS: What could possibly go wrong?\nTIMBERG: Just give us an example.\nWOODS: You know, with the Internet of Things\u2014Dan Geer likes to say, on the internet every psychopath is your next door neighbor. Now we're connecting that psychopath to things that we depend on critically\u2014like energy sector, like transportation, like health care. What could possibly go wrong with that? I would like to say that I'm optimistic that we'll have it all fixed in the next five or ten years at a policy level. But the reality is, even if you fix it at the policy level from some magic wand, which doesn't exist, right\u2014we don't have the fixes in mind yet. We'll have to build them. But the research and development time, the lead time and the legacy systems are going to carry us through the next few decades. So I think five to ten years from now is going to look like today, only more.\nHOWE: And can I just add one thing, from a national security perspective? So when it comes to national strategy, it's not just about security. It's also about R&D, as you said. And who's going to own the innovation when it comes to all sorts of technologies that we care a lot about\u2014whether it's quantum computing, artificial intelligence, or frankly even the Internet of Things? So when you look at drone technology, for example, China has the lead on drone technology because they are funding the companies that are developing this technology. And the U.S. companies cannot compete from a price performance perspective, because they have to raise venture money\u2014or money from somewhere\u2014in order to innovate.\nSo we just have to be very thoughtful as we look at this. The innovation is going to happen. It's going to transform the way we work, live, and play. And as these billions of devices are going out there, who do we want to be owning the front end of that innovation curve? And that's something we should also be thinking about.\nTIMBERG: So that brings me to another question. If we agree there's a problem here that's likely to get worse, for all the reasons we've been discussing, who should be taking this on? The hardware makers? The software makers? The U.S. government? The United Nations? The hackers of the world? Rob, you were in the White House, tell us, what's the solution here?\nKNAKE: So I think the real answer is to figure out how we assign liability, right? The typical answer is we want to assign liability to the criminals behind this act, right? And so in the case of the Mirai botnet, they were dumb kids in New Jersey. We were able to do the forensics on it, figure out who they were, attribute it to them, and arrest them, and they're going to go to jail. That's usually not what happens in the cyber underworld, because we don't have the ability to reach cyber criminals in Ukraine, Russia, China, the list goes on and on. Even if we can do the attribution and figure it out, getting the individual back to the United States and putting them in jail is something that we don't have the greatest record at.\nThat's not to say it's not possible. That's not to say that it doesn't happen. I see a whole bunch of ex DOJ colleagues of mine in the back of the room. You guys do a great job. But that's not ultimately the solution. And so we've got to figure out, how do we place liability somewhere else in the chain? I would say on an international perspective, we need to take an approach where we're willing to assign liability, and accept liability, as a nation when U.S. computers are used to attack France. We should have some liability and some responsibility for figuring that problem out.\nTIMBERG: So, but as a country, not as the companies that make those computers, or the software makers who make the software that runs those computers, or all of the above?\nKNAKE: I would say you need to go down that line. I think one of the laws that we need to fix is we need to have a way that we, as consumers, can hold device makers responsible. I also think we need to have a legal construct in which we can hold the device makers, the ISPs, and possibly the companies that are operating insecure devices liable, if those insecure devices are harming a third party, right? So in the case of the botnet attacks against the financial services community in 2011, '12, and '13, it was servers operated by companies like GoDaddy out of Texas that were compromised and were DDoSing the banks. Under our current construct, we would never hold GoDaddy or their users who had insecure WordPress installations liable. I think we probably need to extend liability to those people in order to solve the problem. It doesn't seem fair to many people. And I agree maybe it's not fair. But I think it would be effective.\nTIMBERG: Niloo\u2014oh, sorry\u2014Beau, go ahead.\nWOODS: Yeah, I think\u2014so there's two industries that call their users \"users,\" are software and illegal drugs. (Laughter.) Those two industries are also exempt from liability in the U.S. So, you know, you can make a connection if you want to. There are better ways and worse ways to impose liability on device makers and on operators. And I think that what we need to have\u2014what we need to start with is to have an open and honest dialogue on where liability should be placed in the supply chain and chain of operations.\nHOWE: So I think, before we start imposing regulation on a nascent industry where technology is going to move much faster than policymakers can possibly keep up with, we should think about the tools that are available and at our disposal, right? So when you look at botnets, for example, the number one country where botnets come out of is Brazil. And it's because it's a safe haven for cyber criminal activity. We have some pretty good incentives we could probably use to get Brazil to start taking this stuff a little bit more serious. We can use a carrot and stick approach. The victim, by the way, is not\u2014number one\u2014is not the U.S. It's a shared problem globally across EU, U.K., Asia, and the U.S. So we can come together and start using some pretty big sticks to discourage criminal activity.\nThe second thing I would say is when we decide to do it, we actually do get it done. So we took down Silk Road. And since then, we've been able to take down almost every massive underground cybercriminal hub, because the world is aligned to do that, right? We take them down. Now, typically the userbase is in the hundreds of thousands, which is kind of crazy when you think about it, right? The mob, when you had a RICO action, it'd be, what, like a handful of people, a dozen people? We're talking about hundreds of thousands of users that are coming together. But they sell things that we know are bad. They sell drugs. They sell weapons. They sell child pornography. And we're going to take them down every single time.\nSo I do think that if we were aligned, and there was a global incentive to do it, we have shown that we can actually take down these criminal networks, and we can solve the attribution problem. And I think it goes beyond liability in the private sector. I think it's\u2014clearly, the private sector has to own their piece of this. Consumers probably need to at some point wake up to their piece of it. But I do think the government has to take responsibility as well. And it needs to own its piece of it, not just for the IoT ecosystem, but cybersecurity in general. And when the government steps up and does it, I think it's the single most powerful tool that we have. And without the government getting involved, I think it's very hard to solve this problem.\nTIMBERG: So before we came on the stage, Rob was telling me about another approach. Was it IoT chemotherapy, is that right? And that I believe he was advocating, right? I mean, hackers of the world take it into their own hands, am I right? Sort of vigilantes?\nKNAKE: So, to be clear, I don't think I was advocating anything. I think this is an interesting idea. (Laughter.) It was probably three or four years ago that the security community started to notice that somebody was going around and bricking IoT devices, purposely breaking them so they could not be infected and taken over by bot masters. And about a year after that, allegedly the person who was behind it said, OK, I'm going to stop doing this. It's probably too dangerous. I'm not sure it's a good approach. But this is something that governments might want to think about doing. Not as an individual vigilante.\nIt's an interesting concept. If you have a device that is either already a part of a botnet or is susceptible to being part of a botnet because it has a known vulnerability that can be exploited over the internet, it may be worth thinking about whether it makes sense to take those devices offline.\nTIMBERG: Isn't there a Fourth Amendment issue with that, for if the government is going into people's devices and extracting information, and acting on them without legal process?\nKNAKE: You're the only lawyer we have on the table.\nHOWE: I was an entertainment lawyer like twenty years ago, so. (Laughter.)\nTIMBERG: It seems like that might be an issue.\nWOODS: With that approach, you don't have to take information off. You can just disable the device completely. That's it. It's a different approach.\nTIMBERG: I think when you talk about hackers doing it, I was thinking OK. If the government does it\u2014that's\u2014I would think you would need legal process of some sort.\nKNAKE: Well, if a hacker does it, it's definitely a crime.\nTIMBERG: No, I get that, but\u2014\nKNAKE: So I think it's an interesting question about how do we manage these devices that nobody else seems to manage? And could you come up with a construct in which you say: This device has been effectively abandoned?\nTIMBERG: And to be clear, you're not actually advocating this. I was teasing. You're just raising this as an idea.\nKNAKE: Raising this as an idea.\nTIMBERG: But I was curious what you\u2014\nHOWE: This issue goes beyond IoT, though, right? Like, when Microsoft stops supporting some, you know, NOS, and people keep using it, we end up with situations like we did with WannaCry and NotPetya. So the issue of outdated firmware, outdated software, unpatched systems is much broader than IoT. And it's a heretical approach. (Laughter.)\nTIMBERG: Well, on that note, so it's 1:00. We're going to open this up to our members here. You can join the conversation. I want to remind everybody, this is all on the record. It's being livestreamed over the internet. I believe there's some journalists here. So I'm going to call on people. You're going to wait for the microphone, please. And then please stand and state your name, and your affiliation, and ask only one question. Keep it concise. And so we can allow as many people to participate as possible. Why don't we start with the lady right here? If we can get a microphone to her, that would be great.\nQ: I'm Mitzi Wertheim with the Naval Postgraduate School.\nI don't have any computer skills, but by God do I understand how complicated it is, because I worked with Art Cebrowski when he was getting the whole thing going in the Defense Department.

Hearing what we heard today, how can you create a visual story so the rest of the company\u2014country can understand how incredibly complex this is?\nTIMBERG: I'll take a stab at that.

While Google is set to reveal all the details of its Stadia service at its own Stadia Connect event today, Microsoft will likely take the announcement of its own service to its Xbox E3 press conference scheduled on 10 June. Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, discusses the Xbox One family of devices. Image: Microsoft.\nMicrosoft has a lot on its plate this year with announcements across games, software, and hardware at E3 2019. However, the most interesting to us is its cloud streaming service Project xCloud. Absolutely nothing was known about the service until now, whether it's about the pricing or how powerful it's going to be. Microsoft has been talking about it for more than a year but there hasn't been any official reveal about the service. However, at E3 20190, that might change.\nAccording to a speculative piece by Thurrott on Microsoft's E3 plans, Project xCloud is supposedly more powerful than Google Stadia. \"While I don't think Microsoft will share the raw performance figures of xCloud, I have heard that it does best Google's previously announced 10.7 teraflops,\" said the report.\nThe report goes on to mention that a live demo of xCloud was also a part of the plan for the press conference. In the demo, a remote location away from the venue will be used to showcase someone using xCloud from their home.\nSony had recently announced a partnership with Microsoft for a cloud streaming service as well. Sony's version will take advantage of Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, which means that Microsoft could potentially be host to two of the largest gaming platforms in the world.\nMany leaks have been doing the rounds since a few months and the list of games includes Halo: Infinite , Gears 5 , Age of Empires IV and a new Fable game. This year, Xbox is the only console that will be present at E3 since Sony has backed out from presenting anything. Although we might not get a full reveal of the next generation of Xbox gaming consoles, the company could share details about its performance bump and a few highlighted features.\nTech2 is now on WhatsApp. For all the buzz on the latest tech and science, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

And people were saying nothing to worry about, Google can't break into gaming. this means a lot less than you're implying MS titles coming to PS5 via streaming? Could it be? :O So gaming, AI and semiconductors (image sensors), interesting #21 Makes sense. Kind of like how Apple buys assets from Samsung to build their devices. They buy shit from their rivals. Google is clutching her pearls now! Collaboration to compete with Stadia? Sony just shot themselves in the foot... Ok, this stopped me in my tracks, I was out the door for lunch. Can we stop fighting now? MS is making some really interesting moves and im totally down to see where it leads. MS have the better infrastructure, Sony have a streaming service that a lot of people actually use. Seems like a reasonable pairing. A mod can edit if they want, I just used the title of the Microsoft article. I added the cloud stuff to the OP as well, thanks! More like what works for Nintendo works for them. I like a good twist. Everyone thought it would begin with Skynet but this is how it really starts. I'm getting flashbacks to Astro Boy Omega Factor having splash screens for Nintendo, Sega and Sony Perfectly encapsulated my reaction reading the OP woah, this is really intersting! wonder how this works out. So focused on Azure to use it for PSNow? #43 Sounds like Sony will be using Microsoft's cloud base for any streaming efforts next gen. Which makes them no different from countless other major corporations that use Microsoft's products and services. It is potentially interesting that they're being so public about this partnership, and I wonder if it's part of a larger effort to combat Google & Stadia by working together instead of competing with each other. If Microsoft makes Sony's streaming tech better, that's sending fewer customers to Google. If you want to keep a new competitor from gaining a foothold in the market, that's a good way to start.", "URL": "https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-and-microsoft-to-explore-strategic-partnership-regarding-cloud-based-tech-for-gaming-ai.117337/"}, {"Title": "GTA 5 is Streaming on Sony\u2019s Subscription Service PlayStation Now", "Text": "GTA 5 is Streaming on Sony's Subscription Service PlayStation Now GTA 5 is Streaming on Sony's Subscription Service PlayStation Now Tweet\nGrand Theft Auto 5 is one of the most popular videogames released till now. It is an open world game where players can choose between three characters and complete missions from their overlapping storylines. In a recent interview, the president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, Jim Ryan said that they have negotiated a deal with Rockstar Games under which they have purchased rights to stream GTA 5 from PlayStation Now. What is PlayStation Now?\nPlayStation Now is Sony's subscription based cloud gaming service. Using PlayStation Now, gamers can play PS2, PS3, and PS4 titles from PC, as well as PlayStation 4. Players don't have to buy or download games with PS Now since it is a cloud gaming service. PlayStation Now currently provides unlimited access to over 660 PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 game titles under its subscription plan. GTA 5 on PlayStation Now\nDue to the growing competition from Google's Stadia and Xbox Gaming Pass, the subscription prices for PlayStation Now were reduced and Sony is now looking for big game titles like GTA 5 to make their service more desirable to gamers.\nWe don't know if Sony owns the exclusive rights to streaming GTA 5 but Jim Ryan, CEO of SIE said in an interview that GTA 5 will stream only on PlayStation Now \"to the best of my knowledge.\" He also said that the deal was good for Rockstar which means that Sony offered a considerable amount for the rights to stream GTA 5 through PS Now. Competition from other Subscription Based Gaming Services\nWhatever the terms of their deal may be, it is clear that Sony is making big moves to make its subscription gaming service stand out among competitors like Xbox Game Pass and Google Stadia. Rockstar Games was also announced as a partner for Google Stadia but there aren't any games that are announced yet. As the deal isn't exclusive officially, Rockstar may allow GTA 5 on other subscription gaming services too.\nMicrosoft will also start public testing of its xCloud streaming service for video games this month. We don't know which titles will be available on the xCloud yet. Google Stadia currently has partnered with game developers like Rockstar Games, Capcom, and EA. But they haven't announced their titles for Google Stadia yet. We will get to know more about the titles when it officially launches next month.

It's a streaming platform, so instead of having to buy a physical copy or download massive files, people can play games that are run on servers at Google's data centers.\nThe news could spur Microsoft on to reveal more about its own streaming service, Project xCloud. The company has long been a household name in the E3 lineup, alongside Sony \u2014 although interestingly, the latter isn't showing up at this year's event.\n\"Cloud gaming will be front and center of many discussions at E3 as the industry adapts to the changing business models,\" Candice Mudrick, head of analysis at industry research group Newzoo, told CNBC by email.\n\"Microsoft and Google are the main ones to watch for, and Stadia has already released details on its service ahead of E3.\"\nThe ability to jump into a game from a computer or tablet could prove appealing for gamers. At the Stadia demo earlier this year, the company said a player could watch a video of a game on YouTube and click a button that lets gamers play it in as fast as five seconds.\n'Disrupt the console gaming ecosystem' Google said Thursday that the service would cost about $10 per month, while the controller used to play it will cost around $70. It will only come with 30 games from major publishers including Electronic Arts, Warner Bros., 2K and Sega, with just two being Stadia exclusives. It's set to launch in November this year.\nA prominent lack of exclusives could be a challenge for the Silicon Valley titan, as Microsoft's E3 lineup is expected to include blockbuster Xbox only titles including \"Halo Infinite\" and \"Gears 5.\"\n\"In our view, Google's service has the potential to disrupt the console gaming ecosystem that has been dominated by Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony for decades,\" analysts at Wedbush said in a recent note. However, they added that Stadia's business model and third party support remained \"key question marks.\"\nFollowing the initial announcement of Google Stadia, Sony announced a partnership with Microsoft that sees the Japanese tech giant using the latter's Azure cloud service for streaming games and media.\nWedbush analysts said the Sony Microsoft deal was \"driven in part\" by Google's game streaming service. Microsoft could get the upper hand, though, given Sony has decided not to attend this year's expo.\nMichael Patcher, managing director of equity research at Wedbush, told CNBC Sony's decision not to join this year's E3 was a \"mistake\" as the cost of hosting a press conference at the show is \"minor in comparison to the publicity they receive.\"\nMicrosoft could, therefore, take the spotlight given its biggest hardware competitor won't grab anywhere near the same level of publicity.\nThe company is also expected to announce details on its upcoming next generation console. With Sony skipping 2019's E3, Microsoft could use it as an opportunity to reveal more information on the next Xbox. Sony did, however, announce some new details about the next PlayStation console on Thursday.\nNevertheless, streaming could prove a headline generator at E3 2019. According to Newzoo's Mudrick, this could be Microsoft's opportunity to latch onto the streaming phenomenon.\n\"Given Stadia's reveal today without \"killer app\" games that are must haves for ultimate gamers, there is opportunity for Microsoft to swoop in,\" she said.", "URL": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-apos-streaming-platform-could-141352811.html"}, {"Title": "How Sony bought, and squandered, the future of cloud gaming", "Text": "Stop me if you've heard this one before: a video game platform that lets you play games with the press of a button, no need for discs or downloads.

Ask a friend to take over your controller from across the internet.\nIf that sounds like the lofty pitch for Google's Stadia cloud gaming service , you've been paying attention. But every single one of those things was promised years ago by a startup named Gaikai \u2014 a startup that Sony bought in 2012 for $380 million. At the time, Sony gave every indication that it would harness the full potential of a PlayStation cloud. It even bought Gaikai's closest competitor, OnLive , in 2015 and launched a service called PlayStation Now that finally hit 1 million subscribers in October. But half a decade later, the company has barely tapped into cloud gaming's promise, and competitors like Google seem poised to attract the gamers that Sony failed to convert.\nI doubt it's a coincidence that Google and Gaikai's pitches sound so similar. As Gaikai co founder, CEO, and former PlayStation Now chief David Perry pointed out to me in an interview on the day Stadia debuted, Google gaming boss Phil Harrison used to sit on Gaikai's advisory board. Jack Buser, Stadia's head of business development, used to run Sony's PlayStation Now. Heck, a clean shaven Sundar Pichai was the one who first introduced how Gaikai could stream games natively in the Chrome web browser three years before he became Google's CEO.\nRelated\nGoogle Stadia review: the best of cloud gaming is still just a beta The world is waiting for Google Stadia to flop Mind you, Google is already having plenty of trouble meeting the lofty goals it cribbed from Gaikai, breaking many of the promises it made before launch. But how did Sony let Google become the front runner in cloud gaming to begin with, after having the better part of a decade to freely build it out?\nLet's take a quick trip back to February 2013 when Sony introduced the PlayStation 4 and revealed Gaikai's newfound role in the whole thing. When Perry strode onstage, he presented a vision of a PlayStation Network like we'd never seen before, one that would let you instantly try any game before you buy it. His words:\nWith the Gaikai cloud technology, our goal is to make free exploration possible for virtually any PlayStation 4 game in the PlayStation Store. Imagine you're in the store, checking out the latest titles and you see something that catches your eye: no problem. You can simply press the X button to hop in and start playing the game. Now in the past, not all games were available, and the ones that were had to be kind of the 'lite' version, where they'd been edited down so they could be downloaded reasonably quickly. With Gaikai and the PlayStation Store, you'll be able to instantly experience anything that you want. I've always liked that concept of try it for free, share it if you like it, and pay only for the games you fall in love with.\nIt's easy to forget this was Gaikai's pitch from the start: instant free demos of games you can try before you buy, using practically any device you own.\nI got an exclusive first look at Gaikai in December 2010, and I'll never forget what Perry asked me afterward: not whether the streaming quality was good, but if I'd experienced enough to figure out whether the game was worth buying. That was why Gaikai originally streamed games from YouTube and Facebook ads \u2014 they were legitimately ads! \u2014 though Gaikai was also willing to let publishers stand up their own servers and set their own pricing if gamers wanted to turn those ads into game time.\nWhen I visited Gaikai's headquarters in June 2012, I was amazed by how many endpoints Gaikai had already built. Both LG and Samsung TVs were slated to feature the service. It worked with an off the shelf Android tablet. Best Buy and Walmart had live game demos you could play on their websites, and you could share demos on Facebook with your friends and relatives if you liked.\nBut Perry says most of that went out the window when he cashed Sony's check. \"After Sony acquired Gaikai, we went quiet. I stopped giving speeches, I stopped pushing this as the future of the industry... We withdrew from all the deals,\" he relates.\nThough Perry says he's loyal to Sony for buying Gaikai and eventually building a service with 1 million subscribers instead of just \"shoving it somewhere in a drawer,\" he says his personal opinion is that Sony didn't really understand what to do with Gaikai, and he started by trying to shoehorn Gaikai's tech into a way to sell its own hardware.\n\"Sony acquired something that they thought would be a good idea to buy because they could feel the momentum, and I don't think at the time it was clear to them which business they were in,\" Perry says. \"If you are in charge of PlayStation, are you in the hardware business or are you in the gameplay business? I don't think that was clear. Because if you're in the hardware business, this isn't very interesting. If you're the guys building hardware, and someone starts talking about the cloud, it's just like, 'Meh, we've got work to do.'\"\nAnd \"meh\" was definitely how I felt when Sony's PlayStation Now cloud gaming service debuted. When an open beta launched in late 2014, it was ridiculed as the antiquated Blockbuster of video games : a service where you'd have to rent each PS3 title \u2014 and only PS3 titles \u2014 for more than you'd pay to buy a used disc at GameStop. It felt like an expensive way to cover for the fact that the PS4 wasn't backwards compatible with PS3 games.\nSony later added a $20 a month subscription service for a selection of less desirable games alongside the rentals (it eventually ditched rentals altogether), and it expanded support to the PS3, PS Vita, PlayStation TV, a handful of Sony TVs and Blu ray players, and even a few Samsung smart TVs.\nBut it took until late 2016 for Sony to finally let you play PlayStation games on a PC , and it was mid 2017 before it added a back catalog of current gen PS4 titles instead of exclusively older games. And it was tough luck if you wanted to play those PS4 games on your Sony handheld or smart TV because Sony ditched every other platform , save PC and PS4, along the way. It was just last month when Sony finally dropped the price of PlayStation Now to a more reasonable $60 a year and deigned to add a few flagship games like God of War and Uncharted 4. But even those $20 \"greatest hits\" games will only be available to stream through January 2nd, 2020.\nEven though Sony has finally stopped trying to use its PS4 Remote Play app to sell Sony smartphones, and it opened it up to iPhone and Android gamers (years after shutting down a perfectly good hack ), there's no parallel PlayStation Now mobile app in sight. Sony completely ceded the Gaikai / OnLive era idea of delivering cloud games directly to phones. That's where Microsoft's xCloud is now striking first and where Google and early Gaikai partner Nvidia may also have an opportunity.\nThere are reasons why Sony took it slow with Gaikai \u2014 they're just unfortunate reasons \u2014 like how Sony's initial PlayStation Now service relied on having actual PS3 hardware in the data center for every single player. That capped Sony's physical and economic ability to expand the service as quickly as it might have liked. Or how the company wound up diverting its attention to VR.\n\"VR took all the air in the room for a while.\" \"Cloud gaming is working. We've demonstrated it. We're sort of waiting for things to get better and have more power in the cloud, faster internet speeds, all the rest of it... And then VR comes out, and VR took all the air in the room for a while,\" says Perry. He also points out that Sony never put much marketing behind PS Now or ran a real ad until last month. Sony also never wound up offering a bundle with its other subscription services like PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Vue, for that matter.\nWhen I ask Perry what happened to the key part of his original vision \u2014 the idea that PS4 players would be able to instantly sample games for free \u2014 he admits that Sony never actually tried.\n\"It was something I was passionate about, but I don't think it had the support of others,\" says Perry, adding that he found it wasn't necessarily compatible with \"the harsh reality of business.\" One example: he spoke to a publisher who told him, \"David, we don't want anyone to play our game.\" When Perry asked why, he says they replied: \"Because the trailer does a better job of convincing them our game is good. The game isn't very good to be honest, but the trailer makes it look good.\" It was a clarifying moment.\n\"We don't want anyone to play our game.\" Even so, Perry says he believes gamers would \"have to be insane not to sign up\" for PlayStation Now at the new lower price, as long as they spend a lot of time gaming. \"The amount of games you're getting for the money is absurd.\" But he also believes that Sony, Google, and other prospective cloud gaming providers need to stop trying to stick existing gaming components into their servers and convince publishers to build and share their best games instead of just a back catalog of titles. \"They have to decide that this is the future.\"\nPerry's somewhat worried that cloud gaming will adopt the same pattern we're seeing with other streaming media today , where Disney and HBO and Apple and many more are all standing up their own video delivery services to compete with Netflix for our attention. \"When things get out of control, you end up with multiple streaming services. And you want to watch Harry Potter, and you don't know where it is,\" he says. Sony had seven unchallenged years to convince publishers, but now Google, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Microsoft, Nintendo, Amazon, Verizon, Walmart, Nvidia, and others are all testing the waters for their own possible cloud gaming subscriptions.\nNone of this is to say Sony wasted those seven years or made the wrong decisions. The PlayStation 4 wound up becoming a phenomenal success. It's the second best selling console of all time having shipped over 102 million units, handily winning this console generation. PlayStation VR is also one of the best selling console accessories ever , even if VR hasn't taken off quite yet. And Sony did need to make some hard choices during the past decade to turn around its foundering business. This is the decade Sony decided it was no longer an electronics company , chopping off pieces of itself to survive.\nSome of Gaikai's know how might have even been responsible for that success. In 2012, Gaikai showed me a demo where you could start playing a game while the rest of it downloads in the background \u2014 something that became a core feature of the PlayStation 4. Share Play, a feature that lets you see a friend's screen from over the internet and then take over the controls, also eventually shipped. But even if Sony doesn't become a front runner in cloud gaming, buying Gaikai and OnLive early on means it has a lot of patents on the tech.\nWhen I try it again for the first time in years, I have to admit PlayStation Now isn't bad. I'm streaming God of War on my Windows desktop at a fairly lackluster 720p resolution, but with nary a hitch. There's no way I'd spend $10 a month or $60 a year for that experience \u2014 not when I can own those same games permanently for $10 or less per disc \u2014 but I would pay if Sony gave me the latest games there. Better yet, I'd pay to get games that aren't even possible on console, with hundreds or thousands of simultaneous players, incredibly advanced physics simulations, and AI voiced NPCs that don't just repeat the same pre programmed lines of dialogue. It's not clear whether Sony has any intent to do so \u2014 and now it'll have to fight its own ideas in the hands of much wealthier adversaries like Google. All we know for sure is that the PlayStation 5 is coming, and Sony has a vague interest in maximizing the \"off console opportunity\" of cloud gaming as well.\nIn 2014, Perry claimed that Sony had \"fully greenlit\" a project where Gaikai would help build \"the fastest global network ever made\" to let gamers play like never before. That may still be the plan, but Sony's going to need some help. That may be why it struck a cloud gaming partnership with Microsoft this May, teaming up with its chief rival.\nSony was one of the few companies that believed in cloud gaming enough to spend big in 2012, just as it was one of the few that believed in VR. But that wasn't enough to make Sony a leader.\nRelated\nMicrosoft and Sony are teaming up for the future of gaming\nPlayStation 25th anniversary issue Hardware 4 How the PlayStation's DualShock shaped modern controllers The rise and fall of the PlayStation supercomputers Remember how simple consoles used to be with this original PlayStation teardown The portable PlayStations were Sony at its most ambitious Games and culture 6 One of PlayStation's most important studios makes games about loneliness Naughty Dog's president on how games changed since the first PlayStation: 'They're barely recognizable' How to play classic PlayStation games in 2019 Why Final Fantasy became the face of Sony's first PlayStation How the PlayStation logo became a streetwear icon The PlayStation 3 was Blu ray's ultimate Trojan horse", "URL": "https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"}]}, {"client": "ITOCHU CORPORATION | GB000WK6", "industry": "Computer Services", "segment": "Commercial", "intensity": 37.0, "market": "Japan", "products": "Google Cloud Platform", "score": 289.0, "relationshipStrength": "Strong", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": [{"Title": "Microsoft\u2019s Project xCloud rumoured to be more powerful than Google Stadia", "Text": "tech2 News Staff Jun 06, 2019 21:04:04 IST\nCloud gaming is going to be a highly discussed topic this year. While Google is set to reveal all the details of its Stadia service at its own Stadia Connect event today, Microsoft will likely take the announcement of its own service to its Xbox E3 press conference scheduled on 10 June. Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, discusses the Xbox One family of devices. Image: Microsoft.\nMicrosoft has a lot on its plate this year with announcements across games, software, and hardware at E3 2019. However, the most interesting to us is its cloud streaming service Project xCloud. Absolutely nothing was known about the service until now, whether it's about the pricing or how powerful it's going to be. Microsoft has been talking about it for more than a year but there hasn't been any official reveal about the service. However, at E3 20190, that might change.\nAccording to a speculative piece by Thurrott on Microsoft's E3 plans, Project xCloud is supposedly more powerful than Google Stadia. \"While I don't think Microsoft will share the raw performance figures of xCloud, I have heard that it does best Google's previously announced 10.7 teraflops,\" said the report.\nThe report goes on to mention that a live demo of xCloud was also a part of the plan for the press conference. In the demo, a remote location away from the venue will be used to showcase someone using xCloud from their home.\nSony had recently announced a partnership with Microsoft for a cloud streaming service as well. Sony's version will take advantage of Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, which means that Microsoft could potentially be host to two of the largest gaming platforms in the world.\nMany leaks have been doing the rounds since a few months and the list of games includes Halo: Infinite , Gears 5 , Age of Empires IV and a new Fable game. This year, Xbox is the only console that will be present at E3 since Sony has backed out from presenting anything. Although we might not get a full reveal of the next generation of Xbox gaming consoles, the company could share details about its performance bump and a few highlighted features.\nTech2 is now on WhatsApp. For all the buzz on the latest tech and science, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

And people were saying nothing to worry about, Google can't break into gaming. this means a lot less than you're implying MS titles coming to PS5 via streaming? Could it be? :O So gaming, AI and semiconductors (image sensors), interesting #21 Makes sense. Kind of like how Apple buys assets from Samsung to build their devices. They buy shit from their rivals. Google is clutching her pearls now! Collaboration to compete with Stadia? Sony just shot themselves in the foot... Ok, this stopped me in my tracks, I was out the door for lunch. Can we stop fighting now? MS is making some really interesting moves and im totally down to see where it leads. MS have the better infrastructure, Sony have a streaming service that a lot of people actually use. Seems like a reasonable pairing. A mod can edit if they want, I just used the title of the Microsoft article. I added the cloud stuff to the OP as well, thanks! More like what works for Nintendo works for them. I like a good twist. Everyone thought it would begin with Skynet but this is how it really starts. I'm getting flashbacks to Astro Boy Omega Factor having splash screens for Nintendo, Sega and Sony Perfectly encapsulated my reaction reading the OP woah, this is really intersting! wonder how this works out. So focused on Azure to use it for PSNow? #43 Sounds like Sony will be using Microsoft's cloud base for any streaming efforts next gen. Which makes them no different from countless other major corporations that use Microsoft's products and services. It is potentially interesting that they're being so public about this partnership, and I wonder if it's part of a larger effort to combat Google & Stadia by working together instead of competing with each other. If Microsoft makes Sony's streaming tech better, that's sending fewer customers to Google. If you want to keep a new competitor from gaining a foothold in the market, that's a good way to start.", "URL": "https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-and-microsoft-to-explore-strategic-partnership-regarding-cloud-based-tech-for-gaming-ai.117337/"}, {"Title": "GTA 5 is Streaming on Sony\u2019s Subscription Service PlayStation Now", "Text": "GTA 5 is Streaming on Sony's Subscription Service PlayStation Now GTA 5 is Streaming on Sony's Subscription Service PlayStation Now Tweet\nGrand Theft Auto 5 is one of the most popular videogames released till now. It is an open world game where players can choose between three characters and complete missions from their overlapping storylines. In a recent interview, the president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, Jim Ryan said that they have negotiated a deal with Rockstar Games under which they have purchased rights to stream GTA 5 from PlayStation Now. What is PlayStation Now?\nPlayStation Now is Sony's subscription based cloud gaming service. Using PlayStation Now, gamers can play PS2, PS3, and PS4 titles from PC, as well as PlayStation 4. Players don't have to buy or download games with PS Now since it is a cloud gaming service. PlayStation Now currently provides unlimited access to over 660 PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 game titles under its subscription plan. GTA 5 on PlayStation Now\nDue to the growing competition from Google's Stadia and Xbox Gaming Pass, the subscription prices for PlayStation Now were reduced and Sony is now looking for big game titles like GTA 5 to make their service more desirable to gamers.\nWe don't know if Sony owns the exclusive rights to streaming GTA 5 but Jim Ryan, CEO of SIE said in an interview that GTA 5 will stream only on PlayStation Now \"to the best of my knowledge.\" He also said that the deal was good for Rockstar which means that Sony offered a considerable amount for the rights to stream GTA 5 through PS Now. Competition from other Subscription Based Gaming Services\nWhatever the terms of their deal may be, it is clear that Sony is making big moves to make its subscription gaming service stand out among competitors like Xbox Game Pass and Google Stadia. Rockstar Games was also announced as a partner for Google Stadia but there aren't any games that are announced yet. As the deal isn't exclusive officially, Rockstar may allow GTA 5 on other subscription gaming services too.\nMicrosoft will also start public testing of its xCloud streaming service for video games this month. We don't know which titles will be available on the xCloud yet. Google Stadia currently has partnered with game developers like Rockstar Games, Capcom, and EA. But they haven't announced their titles for Google Stadia yet. We will get to know more about the titles when it officially launches next month.

It's a streaming platform, so instead of having to buy a physical copy or download massive files, people can play games that are run on servers at Google's data centers.\nThe news could spur Microsoft on to reveal more about its own streaming service, Project xCloud. The company has long been a household name in the E3 lineup, alongside Sony \u2014 although interestingly, the latter isn't showing up at this year's event.\n\"Cloud gaming will be front and center of many discussions at E3 as the industry adapts to the changing business models,\" Candice Mudrick, head of analysis at industry research group Newzoo, told CNBC by email.\n\"Microsoft and Google are the main ones to watch for, and Stadia has already released details on its service ahead of E3.\"\nThe ability to jump into a game from a computer or tablet could prove appealing for gamers. At the Stadia demo earlier this year, the company said a player could watch a video of a game on YouTube and click a button that lets gamers play it in as fast as five seconds.\n'Disrupt the console gaming ecosystem' Google said Thursday that the service would cost about $10 per month, while the controller used to play it will cost around $70. It will only come with 30 games from major publishers including Electronic Arts, Warner Bros., 2K and Sega, with just two being Stadia exclusives. It's set to launch in November this year.\nA prominent lack of exclusives could be a challenge for the Silicon Valley titan, as Microsoft's E3 lineup is expected to include blockbuster Xbox only titles including \"Halo Infinite\" and \"Gears 5.\"\n\"In our view, Google's service has the potential to disrupt the console gaming ecosystem that has been dominated by Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony for decades,\" analysts at Wedbush said in a recent note. However, they added that Stadia's business model and third party support remained \"key question marks.\"\nFollowing the initial announcement of Google Stadia, Sony announced a partnership with Microsoft that sees the Japanese tech giant using the latter's Azure cloud service for streaming games and media.\nWedbush analysts said the Sony Microsoft deal was \"driven in part\" by Google's game streaming service. Microsoft could get the upper hand, though, given Sony has decided not to attend this year's expo.\nMichael Patcher, managing director of equity research at Wedbush, told CNBC Sony's decision not to join this year's E3 was a \"mistake\" as the cost of hosting a press conference at the show is \"minor in comparison to the publicity they receive.\"\nMicrosoft could, therefore, take the spotlight given its biggest hardware competitor won't grab anywhere near the same level of publicity.\nThe company is also expected to announce details on its upcoming next generation console. With Sony skipping 2019's E3, Microsoft could use it as an opportunity to reveal more information on the next Xbox. Sony did, however, announce some new details about the next PlayStation console on Thursday.\nNevertheless, streaming could prove a headline generator at E3 2019. According to Newzoo's Mudrick, this could be Microsoft's opportunity to latch onto the streaming phenomenon.\n\"Given Stadia's reveal today without \"killer app\" games that are must haves for ultimate gamers, there is opportunity for Microsoft to swoop in,\" she said.", "URL": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-apos-streaming-platform-could-141352811.html"}, {"Title": "How Sony bought, and squandered, the future of cloud gaming", "Text": "Stop me if you've heard this one before: a video game platform that lets you play games with the press of a button, no need for discs or downloads. Tap on a YouTube ad for a game, and you're instantly playing in your web browser. Experience the latest and greatest games on your ancient laptop, phone, or tablet, thanks to remote servers instead of having to buy a console or build a powerful gaming PC. Fire up a game on the TV, then seamlessly pick it up on your mobile device. Stuck in a game? Ask a friend to take over your controller from across the internet.\nIf that sounds like the lofty pitch for Google's Stadia cloud gaming service , you've been paying attention. But every single one of those things was promised years ago by a startup named Gaikai \u2014 a startup that Sony bought in 2012 for $380 million. At the time, Sony gave every indication that it would harness the full potential of a PlayStation cloud. It even bought Gaikai's closest competitor, OnLive , in 2015 and launched a service called PlayStation Now that finally hit 1 million subscribers in October. But half a decade later, the company has barely tapped into cloud gaming's promise, and competitors like Google seem poised to attract the gamers that Sony failed to convert.\nI doubt it's a coincidence that Google and Gaikai's pitches sound so similar. As Gaikai co founder, CEO, and former PlayStation Now chief David Perry pointed out to me in an interview on the day Stadia debuted, Google gaming boss Phil Harrison used to sit on Gaikai's advisory board. Jack Buser, Stadia's head of business development, used to run Sony's PlayStation Now. Heck, a clean shaven Sundar Pichai was the one who first introduced how Gaikai could stream games natively in the Chrome web browser three years before he became Google's CEO.\nRelated\nGoogle Stadia review: the best of cloud gaming is still just a beta The world is waiting for Google Stadia to flop Mind you, Google is already having plenty of trouble meeting the lofty goals it cribbed from Gaikai, breaking many of the promises it made before launch. But how did Sony let Google become the front runner in cloud gaming to begin with, after having the better part of a decade to freely build it out?\nLet's take a quick trip back to February 2013 when Sony introduced the PlayStation 4 and revealed Gaikai's newfound role in the whole thing. When Perry strode onstage, he presented a vision of a PlayStation Network like we'd never seen before, one that would let you instantly try any game before you buy it. His words:\nWith the Gaikai cloud technology, our goal is to make free exploration possible for virtually any PlayStation 4 game in the PlayStation Store. Imagine you're in the store, checking out the latest titles and you see something that catches your eye: no problem. You can simply press the X button to hop in and start playing the game. Now in the past, not all games were available, and the ones that were had to be kind of the 'lite' version, where they'd been edited down so they could be downloaded reasonably quickly. With Gaikai and the PlayStation Store, you'll be able to instantly experience anything that you want. I've always liked that concept of try it for free, share it if you like it, and pay only for the games you fall in love with.\nIt's easy to forget this was Gaikai's pitch from the start: instant free demos of games you can try before you buy, using practically any device you own.\nI got an exclusive first look at Gaikai in December 2010, and I'll never forget what Perry asked me afterward: not whether the streaming quality was good, but if I'd experienced enough to figure out whether the game was worth buying. That was why Gaikai originally streamed games from YouTube and Facebook ads \u2014 they were legitimately ads! \u2014 though Gaikai was also willing to let publishers stand up their own servers and set their own pricing if gamers wanted to turn those ads into game time.\nWhen I visited Gaikai's headquarters in June 2012, I was amazed by how many endpoints Gaikai had already built. Both LG and Samsung TVs were slated to feature the service. It worked with an off the shelf Android tablet. Best Buy and Walmart had live game demos you could play on their websites, and you could share demos on Facebook with your friends and relatives if you liked.\nBut Perry says most of that went out the window when he cashed Sony's check. \"After Sony acquired Gaikai, we went quiet. I stopped giving speeches, I stopped pushing this as the future of the industry... We withdrew from all the deals,\" he relates.\nThough Perry says he's loyal to Sony for buying Gaikai and eventually building a service with 1 million subscribers instead of just \"shoving it somewhere in a drawer,\" he says his personal opinion is that Sony didn't really understand what to do with Gaikai, and he started by trying to shoehorn Gaikai's tech into a way to sell its own hardware.\n\"Sony acquired something that they thought would be a good idea to buy because they could feel the momentum, and I don't think at the time it was clear to them which business they were in,\" Perry says. \"If you are in charge of PlayStation, are you in the hardware business or are you in the gameplay business? I don't think that was clear. Because if you're in the hardware business, this isn't very interesting. If you're the guys building hardware, and someone starts talking about the cloud, it's just like, 'Meh, we've got work to do.'\"\nAnd \"meh\" was definitely how I felt when Sony's PlayStation Now cloud gaming service debuted. When an open beta launched in late 2014, it was ridiculed as the antiquated Blockbuster of video games : a service where you'd have to rent each PS3 title \u2014 and only PS3 titles \u2014 for more than you'd pay to buy a used disc at GameStop. It felt like an expensive way to cover for the fact that the PS4 wasn't backwards compatible with PS3 games.\nSony later added a $20 a month subscription service for a selection of less desirable games alongside the rentals (it eventually ditched rentals altogether), and it expanded support to the PS3, PS Vita, PlayStation TV, a handful of Sony TVs and Blu ray players, and even a few Samsung smart TVs.\nBut it took until late 2016 for Sony to finally let you play PlayStation games on a PC , and it was mid 2017 before it added a back catalog of current gen PS4 titles instead of exclusively older games. And it was tough luck if you wanted to play those PS4 games on your Sony handheld or smart TV because Sony ditched every other platform , save PC and PS4, along the way. It was just last month when Sony finally dropped the price of PlayStation Now to a more reasonable $60 a year and deigned to add a few flagship games like God of War and Uncharted 4. But even those $20 \"greatest hits\" games will only be available to stream through January 2nd, 2020.\nEven though Sony has finally stopped trying to use its PS4 Remote Play app to sell Sony smartphones, and it opened it up to iPhone and Android gamers (years after shutting down a perfectly good hack ), there's no parallel PlayStation Now mobile app in sight. Sony completely ceded the Gaikai / OnLive era idea of delivering cloud games directly to phones. That's where Microsoft's xCloud is now striking first and where Google and early Gaikai partner Nvidia may also have an opportunity.\nThere are reasons why Sony took it slow with Gaikai \u2014 they're just unfortunate reasons \u2014 like how Sony's initial PlayStation Now service relied on having actual PS3 hardware in the data center for every single player. That capped Sony's physical and economic ability to expand the service as quickly as it might have liked. Or how the company wound up diverting its attention to VR.\n\"VR took all the air in the room for a while.\" \"Cloud gaming is working. We've demonstrated it. We're sort of waiting for things to get better and have more power in the cloud, faster internet speeds, all the rest of it... And then VR comes out, and VR took all the air in the room for a while,\" says Perry. He also points out that Sony never put much marketing behind PS Now or ran a real ad until last month. Sony also never wound up offering a bundle with its other subscription services like PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Vue, for that matter.\nWhen I ask Perry what happened to the key part of his original vision \u2014 the idea that PS4 players would be able to instantly sample games for free \u2014 he admits that Sony never actually tried.\n\"It was something I was passionate about, but I don't think it had the support of others,\" says Perry, adding that he found it wasn't necessarily compatible with \"the harsh reality of business.\" One example: he spoke to a publisher who told him, \"David, we don't want anyone to play our game.\" When Perry asked why, he says they replied: \"Because the trailer does a better job of convincing them our game is good.

And you want to watch Harry Potter, and you don't know where it is,\" he says. Sony had seven unchallenged years to convince publishers, but now Google, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Microsoft, Nintendo, Amazon, Verizon, Walmart, Nvidia, and others are all testing the waters for their own possible cloud gaming subscriptions.\nNone of this is to say Sony wasted those seven years or made the wrong decisions. The PlayStation 4 wound up becoming a phenomenal success. It's the second best selling console of all time having shipped over 102 million units, handily winning this console generation.

But even if Sony doesn't become a front runner in cloud gaming, buying Gaikai and OnLive early on means it has a lot of patents on the tech.\nWhen I try it again for the first time in years, I have to admit PlayStation Now isn't bad. I'm streaming God of War on my Windows desktop at a fairly lackluster 720p resolution, but with nary a hitch. There's no way I'd spend $10 a month or $60 a year for that experience \u2014 not when I can own those same games permanently for $10 or less per disc \u2014 but I would pay if Sony gave me the latest games there. Better yet, I'd pay to get games that aren't even possible on console, with hundreds or thousands of simultaneous players, incredibly advanced physics simulations, and AI voiced NPCs that don't just repeat the same pre programmed lines of dialogue. It's not clear whether Sony has any intent to do so \u2014 and now it'll have to fight its own ideas in the hands of much wealthier adversaries like Google. All we know for sure is that the PlayStation 5 is coming, and Sony has a vague interest in maximizing the \"off console opportunity\" of cloud gaming as well.\nIn 2014, Perry claimed that Sony had \"fully greenlit\" a project where Gaikai would help build \"the fastest global network ever made\" to let gamers play like never before.

Some providers offer certain technical aspects or software programs that others don't. They may work with different kinds of customers and incorporate different methods for helping those customers to stay efficient.\nDell EMC and VMware Inc. partner to give customers the latest upgrades in the cloud space. Both companies have discovered that collaborating and integrating cloud technology changes into their own operations help them to better understand customers' needs and mindsets, according to Varun Chhabra (pictured, left), vice president of product marketing, Dell EMC cloud platform, at Dell Technologies Inc., and Muneyb Minhazuddin (pictured, right), vice president of product marketing \u2014 cloud, security and workspace solutions \u2014 at VMware Inc.\nChhabra and Minhazuddin spoke with Rebecca Knight ( @knightrm ) and Stu Miniman ( @stu ), co hosts of theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media's mobile livestreaming studio, during the Dell Technologies World event in Las Vegas. They discussed what Dell can provide that other cloud providers can't, the kinds of customers both companies are working with, and how VMware is looking to bring more cloud based applications to customers (see the full interview with transcript here ). (* Disclosure below.)\n[Editor's note: The following answers have been condensed for clarity.]\nMiniman: Let's talk about that public cloud. We know VMware Cloud on AWS sent ripples through the industry \u2014 and the Google Cloud piece. So tell us what's new. Anything different about the Microsoft piece when it becomes a public cloud, and how does that fit within relation to all the other clouds?\nMinhazuddin: We think about customers' choices first. You've got multiple cloud providers. Why are customers going towards the multicloud world? Because applications are going there. VMware's strategy has been to say, \"How do we empower customers with that choice?\" Our AW S partnership is as strong as ever. We continue to innovate there. That was our first choice of platform. We have 4,000 cloud provider partners. They're not small names. They include IBM. They've got Rackspace and some of the biggest cloud providers.\nSo, how do we take our stack and land it in as many public clouds as possible? We took the first step of IBM, then about 4,000 other cloud providers, be it Rackspace , Fujitsu or Hitachi. Then came Amazon, Amazon being the choice of destination for a lot of public clouds. Today, we further extend that with Microsoft , and with Google a few weeks ago, so this is about customers' choices when they want the hybrid multicloud piece. It is app driven. They want this in multiple places.\nKnight: Can you talk about customers you're working with? You don't need to name names, but just how you are enabling those people to be more productive or more collaborative and to get their jobs done?\nChhabra: We have large banks that are standardizing their workloads on VMware today, as have many more organizations, and they're looking for the flexibility to be able to move stuff to the cloud or move it back on premises and not have to reformat. They don't have to change their machine formats. This makes it easy.\nThey want the flexibility to be able to run applications in their bank branches in the cloud, but they don't necessarily want to adopt a new machine format or a new standardized platform. We can now move workloads seamlessly to Azure by using vCenter or other tools that you're familiar with today to be able to provision your workloads.\nMiniman: There are lots of incentives to getting customers onto VMware, but often they're N minus one, two or something like that. How do we manage and make sure that VMware is more cloud like and up to date?\nChhabra: There are two ways to do that. One of them is, because the VMware and Dell EMC teams are working on engineering closely together, we're going to have the latest version supported right out of the gate, so you have an update that's going to work on your hardware or vice versa. That's one level.\nWith VMware Cloud or Dell EMC, we're also providing the ability to basically have hands off management and have that infrastructure run in your data center or your edge locations, but at the same time not have to manage it. You leave that management to Dell Technologies and to VMware to be able to manage that solution for you. We're bringing that public cloud experience to your on premise locations as well.\nWatch the complete video interview below, and be sure to check out more of SiliconANGLE's and theCUBE's coverage of the Dell Technologies World 2019 event.

While Google is set to reveal all the details of its Stadia service at its own Stadia Connect event today, Microsoft will likely take the announcement of its own service to its Xbox E3 press conference scheduled on 10 June. Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, discusses the Xbox One family of devices. Image: Microsoft.\nMicrosoft has a lot on its plate this year with announcements across games, software, and hardware at E3 2019. However, the most interesting to us is its cloud streaming service Project xCloud. Absolutely nothing was known about the service until now, whether it's about the pricing or how powerful it's going to be. Microsoft has been talking about it for more than a year but there hasn't been any official reveal about the service. However, at E3 20190, that might change.\nAccording to a speculative piece by Thurrott on Microsoft's E3 plans, Project xCloud is supposedly more powerful than Google Stadia. \"While I don't think Microsoft will share the raw performance figures of xCloud, I have heard that it does best Google's previously announced 10.7 teraflops,\" said the report.\nThe report goes on to mention that a live demo of xCloud was also a part of the plan for the press conference. In the demo, a remote location away from the venue will be used to showcase someone using xCloud from their home.\nSony had recently announced a partnership with Microsoft for a cloud streaming service as well. Sony's version will take advantage of Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, which means that Microsoft could potentially be host to two of the largest gaming platforms in the world.\nMany leaks have been doing the rounds since a few months and the list of games includes Halo: Infinite , Gears 5 , Age of Empires IV and a new Fable game. This year, Xbox is the only console that will be present at E3 since Sony has backed out from presenting anything. Although we might not get a full reveal of the next generation of Xbox gaming consoles, the company could share details about its performance bump and a few highlighted features.\nTech2 is now on WhatsApp. For all the buzz on the latest tech and science, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

And people were saying nothing to worry about, Google can't break into gaming. this means a lot less than you're implying MS titles coming to PS5 via streaming? Could it be? :O So gaming, AI and semiconductors (image sensors), interesting #21 Makes sense. Kind of like how Apple buys assets from Samsung to build their devices. They buy shit from their rivals. Google is clutching her pearls now! Collaboration to compete with Stadia? Sony just shot themselves in the foot... Ok, this stopped me in my tracks, I was out the door for lunch. Can we stop fighting now? MS is making some really interesting moves and im totally down to see where it leads. MS have the better infrastructure, Sony have a streaming service that a lot of people actually use. Seems like a reasonable pairing. A mod can edit if they want, I just used the title of the Microsoft article. I added the cloud stuff to the OP as well, thanks! More like what works for Nintendo works for them. I like a good twist. Everyone thought it would begin with Skynet but this is how it really starts. I'm getting flashbacks to Astro Boy Omega Factor having splash screens for Nintendo, Sega and Sony Perfectly encapsulated my reaction reading the OP woah, this is really intersting! wonder how this works out. So focused on Azure to use it for PSNow? #43 Sounds like Sony will be using Microsoft's cloud base for any streaming efforts next gen. Which makes them no different from countless other major corporations that use Microsoft's products and services. It is potentially interesting that they're being so public about this partnership, and I wonder if it's part of a larger effort to combat Google & Stadia by working together instead of competing with each other. If Microsoft makes Sony's streaming tech better, that's sending fewer customers to Google. If you want to keep a new competitor from gaining a foothold in the market, that's a good way to start.", "URL": "https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-and-microsoft-to-explore-strategic-partnership-regarding-cloud-based-tech-for-gaming-ai.117337/"}, {"Title": "GTA 5 is Streaming on Sony\u2019s Subscription Service PlayStation Now", "Text": "GTA 5 is Streaming on Sony's Subscription Service PlayStation Now GTA 5 is Streaming on Sony's Subscription Service PlayStation Now Tweet\nGrand Theft Auto 5 is one of the most popular videogames released till now. It is an open world game where players can choose between three characters and complete missions from their overlapping storylines. In a recent interview, the president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, Jim Ryan said that they have negotiated a deal with Rockstar Games under which they have purchased rights to stream GTA 5 from PlayStation Now. What is PlayStation Now?\nPlayStation Now is Sony's subscription based cloud gaming service. Using PlayStation Now, gamers can play PS2, PS3, and PS4 titles from PC, as well as PlayStation 4. Players don't have to buy or download games with PS Now since it is a cloud gaming service. PlayStation Now currently provides unlimited access to over 660 PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 game titles under its subscription plan. GTA 5 on PlayStation Now\nDue to the growing competition from Google's Stadia and Xbox Gaming Pass, the subscription prices for PlayStation Now were reduced and Sony is now looking for big game titles like GTA 5 to make their service more desirable to gamers.\nWe don't know if Sony owns the exclusive rights to streaming GTA 5 but Jim Ryan, CEO of SIE said in an interview that GTA 5 will stream only on PlayStation Now \"to the best of my knowledge.\" He also said that the deal was good for Rockstar which means that Sony offered a considerable amount for the rights to stream GTA 5 through PS Now. Competition from other Subscription Based Gaming Services\nWhatever the terms of their deal may be, it is clear that Sony is making big moves to make its subscription gaming service stand out among competitors like Xbox Game Pass and Google Stadia. Rockstar Games was also announced as a partner for Google Stadia but there aren't any games that are announced yet. As the deal isn't exclusive officially, Rockstar may allow GTA 5 on other subscription gaming services too.\nMicrosoft will also start public testing of its xCloud streaming service for video games this month. We don't know which titles will be available on the xCloud yet. Google Stadia currently has partnered with game developers like Rockstar Games, Capcom, and EA. But they haven't announced their titles for Google Stadia yet. We will get to know more about the titles when it officially launches next month.

It's a streaming platform, so instead of having to buy a physical copy or download massive files, people can play games that are run on servers at Google's data centers.\nThe news could spur Microsoft on to reveal more about its own streaming service, Project xCloud. The company has long been a household name in the E3 lineup, alongside Sony \u2014 although interestingly, the latter isn't showing up at this year's event.\n\"Cloud gaming will be front and center of many discussions at E3 as the industry adapts to the changing business models,\" Candice Mudrick, head of analysis at industry research group Newzoo, told CNBC by email.\n\"Microsoft and Google are the main ones to watch for, and Stadia has already released details on its service ahead of E3.\"\nThe ability to jump into a game from a computer or tablet could prove appealing for gamers. At the Stadia demo earlier this year, the company said a player could watch a video of a game on YouTube and click a button that lets gamers play it in as fast as five seconds.\n'Disrupt the console gaming ecosystem' Google said Thursday that the service would cost about $10 per month, while the controller used to play it will cost around $70. It will only come with 30 games from major publishers including Electronic Arts, Warner Bros., 2K and Sega, with just two being Stadia exclusives. It's set to launch in November this year.\nA prominent lack of exclusives could be a challenge for the Silicon Valley titan, as Microsoft's E3 lineup is expected to include blockbuster Xbox only titles including \"Halo Infinite\" and \"Gears 5.\"\n\"In our view, Google's service has the potential to disrupt the console gaming ecosystem that has been dominated by Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony for decades,\" analysts at Wedbush said in a recent note. However, they added that Stadia's business model and third party support remained \"key question marks.\"\nFollowing the initial announcement of Google Stadia, Sony announced a partnership with Microsoft that sees the Japanese tech giant using the latter's Azure cloud service for streaming games and media.\nWedbush analysts said the Sony Microsoft deal was \"driven in part\" by Google's game streaming service. Microsoft could get the upper hand, though, given Sony has decided not to attend this year's expo.\nMichael Patcher, managing director of equity research at Wedbush, told CNBC Sony's decision not to join this year's E3 was a \"mistake\" as the cost of hosting a press conference at the show is \"minor in comparison to the publicity they receive.\"\nMicrosoft could, therefore, take the spotlight given its biggest hardware competitor won't grab anywhere near the same level of publicity.\nThe company is also expected to announce details on its upcoming next generation console. With Sony skipping 2019's E3, Microsoft could use it as an opportunity to reveal more information on the next Xbox. Sony did, however, announce some new details about the next PlayStation console on Thursday.\nNevertheless, streaming could prove a headline generator at E3 2019. According to Newzoo's Mudrick, this could be Microsoft's opportunity to latch onto the streaming phenomenon.\n\"Given Stadia's reveal today without \"killer app\" games that are must haves for ultimate gamers, there is opportunity for Microsoft to swoop in,\" she said.", "URL": "https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/google-apos-streaming-platform-could-141352811.html"}, {"Title": "How Sony bought, and squandered, the future of cloud gaming", "Text": "Stop me if you've heard this one before: a video game platform that lets you play games with the press of a button, no need for discs or downloads. Tap on a YouTube ad for a game, and you're instantly playing in your web browser. Experience the latest and greatest games on your ancient laptop, phone, or tablet, thanks to remote servers instead of having to buy a console or build a powerful gaming PC. Fire up a game on the TV, then seamlessly pick it up on your mobile device. Stuck in a game? Ask a friend to take over your controller from across the internet.\nIf that sounds like the lofty pitch for Google's Stadia cloud gaming service , you've been paying attention. But every single one of those things was promised years ago by a startup named Gaikai \u2014 a startup that Sony bought in 2012 for $380 million. At the time, Sony gave every indication that it would harness the full potential of a PlayStation cloud. It even bought Gaikai's closest competitor, OnLive , in 2015 and launched a service called PlayStation Now that finally hit 1 million subscribers in October. But half a decade later, the company has barely tapped into cloud gaming's promise, and competitors like Google seem poised to attract the gamers that Sony failed to convert.\nI doubt it's a coincidence that Google and Gaikai's pitches sound so similar. As Gaikai co founder, CEO, and former PlayStation Now chief David Perry pointed out to me in an interview on the day Stadia debuted, Google gaming boss Phil Harrison used to sit on Gaikai's advisory board. Jack Buser, Stadia's head of business development, used to run Sony's PlayStation Now. Heck, a clean shaven Sundar Pichai was the one who first introduced how Gaikai could stream games natively in the Chrome web browser three years before he became Google's CEO.\nRelated\nGoogle Stadia review: the best of cloud gaming is still just a beta The world is waiting for Google Stadia to flop Mind you, Google is already having plenty of trouble meeting the lofty goals it cribbed from Gaikai, breaking many of the promises it made before launch. But how did Sony let Google become the front runner in cloud gaming to begin with, after having the better part of a decade to freely build it out?\nLet's take a quick trip back to February 2013 when Sony introduced the PlayStation 4 and revealed Gaikai's newfound role in the whole thing. When Perry strode onstage, he presented a vision of a PlayStation Network like we'd never seen before, one that would let you instantly try any game before you buy it. His words:\nWith the Gaikai cloud technology, our goal is to make free exploration possible for virtually any PlayStation 4 game in the PlayStation Store. Imagine you're in the store, checking out the latest titles and you see something that catches your eye: no problem. You can simply press the X button to hop in and start playing the game. Now in the past, not all games were available, and the ones that were had to be kind of the 'lite' version, where they'd been edited down so they could be downloaded reasonably quickly. With Gaikai and the PlayStation Store, you'll be able to instantly experience anything that you want. I've always liked that concept of try it for free, share it if you like it, and pay only for the games you fall in love with.\nIt's easy to forget this was Gaikai's pitch from the start: instant free demos of games you can try before you buy, using practically any device you own.\nI got an exclusive first look at Gaikai in December 2010, and I'll never forget what Perry asked me afterward: not whether the streaming quality was good, but if I'd experienced enough to figure out whether the game was worth buying. That was why Gaikai originally streamed games from YouTube and Facebook ads \u2014 they were legitimately ads! \u2014 though Gaikai was also willing to let publishers stand up their own servers and set their own pricing if gamers wanted to turn those ads into game time.\nWhen I visited Gaikai's headquarters in June 2012, I was amazed by how many endpoints Gaikai had already built. Both LG and Samsung TVs were slated to feature the service. It worked with an off the shelf Android tablet. Best Buy and Walmart had live game demos you could play on their websites, and you could share demos on Facebook with your friends and relatives if you liked.\nBut Perry says most of that went out the window when he cashed Sony's check. \"After Sony acquired Gaikai, we went quiet. I stopped giving speeches, I stopped pushing this as the future of the industry... We withdrew from all the deals,\" he relates.\nThough Perry says he's loyal to Sony for buying Gaikai and eventually building a service with 1 million subscribers instead of just \"shoving it somewhere in a drawer,\" he says his personal opinion is that Sony didn't really understand what to do with Gaikai, and he started by trying to shoehorn Gaikai's tech into a way to sell its own hardware.\n\"Sony acquired something that they thought would be a good idea to buy because they could feel the momentum, and I don't think at the time it was clear to them which business they were in,\" Perry says. \"If you are in charge of PlayStation, are you in the hardware business or are you in the gameplay business? I don't think that was clear. Because if you're in the hardware business, this isn't very interesting. If you're the guys building hardware, and someone starts talking about the cloud, it's just like, 'Meh, we've got work to do.'\"\nAnd \"meh\" was definitely how I felt when Sony's PlayStation Now cloud gaming service debuted. When an open beta launched in late 2014, it was ridiculed as the antiquated Blockbuster of video games : a service where you'd have to rent each PS3 title \u2014 and only PS3 titles \u2014 for more than you'd pay to buy a used disc at GameStop. It felt like an expensive way to cover for the fact that the PS4 wasn't backwards compatible with PS3 games.\nSony later added a $20 a month subscription service for a selection of less desirable games alongside the rentals (it eventually ditched rentals altogether), and it expanded support to the PS3, PS Vita, PlayStation TV, a handful of Sony TVs and Blu ray players, and even a few Samsung smart TVs.\nBut it took until late 2016 for Sony to finally let you play PlayStation games on a PC , and it was mid 2017 before it added a back catalog of current gen PS4 titles instead of exclusively older games. And it was tough luck if you wanted to play those PS4 games on your Sony handheld or smart TV because Sony ditched every other platform , save PC and PS4, along the way. It was just last month when Sony finally dropped the price of PlayStation Now to a more reasonable $60 a year and deigned to add a few flagship games like God of War and Uncharted 4. But even those $20 \"greatest hits\" games will only be available to stream through January 2nd, 2020.\nEven though Sony has finally stopped trying to use its PS4 Remote Play app to sell Sony smartphones, and it opened it up to iPhone and Android gamers (years after shutting down a perfectly good hack ), there's no parallel PlayStation Now mobile app in sight. Sony completely ceded the Gaikai / OnLive era idea of delivering cloud games directly to phones. That's where Microsoft's xCloud is now striking first and where Google and early Gaikai partner Nvidia may also have an opportunity.\nThere are reasons why Sony took it slow with Gaikai \u2014 they're just unfortunate reasons \u2014 like how Sony's initial PlayStation Now service relied on having actual PS3 hardware in the data center for every single player. That capped Sony's physical and economic ability to expand the service as quickly as it might have liked. Or how the company wound up diverting its attention to VR.\n\"VR took all the air in the room for a while.\" \"Cloud gaming is working. We've demonstrated it. We're sort of waiting for things to get better and have more power in the cloud, faster internet speeds, all the rest of it... And then VR comes out, and VR took all the air in the room for a while,\" says Perry. He also points out that Sony never put much marketing behind PS Now or ran a real ad until last month. Sony also never wound up offering a bundle with its other subscription services like PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Vue, for that matter.\nWhen I ask Perry what happened to the key part of his original vision \u2014 the idea that PS4 players would be able to instantly sample games for free \u2014 he admits that Sony never actually tried.\n\"It was something I was passionate about, but I don't think it had the support of others,\" says Perry, adding that he found it wasn't necessarily compatible with \"the harsh reality of business.\" One example: he spoke to a publisher who told him, \"David, we don't want anyone to play our game.\" When Perry asked why, he says they replied: \"Because the trailer does a better job of convincing them our game is good. The game isn't very good to be honest, but the trailer makes it look good.\" It was a clarifying moment.\n\"We don't want anyone to play our game.\" Even so, Perry says he believes gamers would \"have to be insane not to sign up\" for PlayStation Now at the new lower price, as long as they spend a lot of time gaming. \"The amount of games you're getting for the money is absurd.\" But he also believes that Sony, Google, and other prospective cloud gaming providers need to stop trying to stick existing gaming components into their servers and convince publishers to build and share their best games instead of just a back catalog of titles. \"They have to decide that this is the future.\"\nPerry's somewhat worried that cloud gaming will adopt the same pattern we're seeing with other streaming media today , where Disney and HBO and Apple and many more are all standing up their own video delivery services to compete with Netflix for our attention. \"When things get out of control, you end up with multiple streaming services. And you want to watch Harry Potter, and you don't know where it is,\" he says. Sony had seven unchallenged years to convince publishers, but now Google, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Microsoft, Nintendo, Amazon, Verizon, Walmart, Nvidia, and others are all testing the waters for their own possible cloud gaming subscriptions.\nNone of this is to say Sony wasted those seven years or made the wrong decisions. The PlayStation 4 wound up becoming a phenomenal success. It's the second best selling console of all time having shipped over 102 million units, handily winning this console generation. PlayStation VR is also one of the best selling console accessories ever , even if VR hasn't taken off quite yet. And Sony did need to make some hard choices during the past decade to turn around its foundering business. This is the decade Sony decided it was no longer an electronics company , chopping off pieces of itself to survive.\nSome of Gaikai's know how might have even been responsible for that success. In 2012, Gaikai showed me a demo where you could start playing a game while the rest of it downloads in the background \u2014 something that became a core feature of the PlayStation 4. Share Play, a feature that lets you see a friend's screen from over the internet and then take over the controls, also eventually shipped. But even if Sony doesn't become a front runner in cloud gaming, buying Gaikai and OnLive early on means it has a lot of patents on the tech.\nWhen I try it again for the first time in years, I have to admit PlayStation Now isn't bad. I'm streaming God of War on my Windows desktop at a fairly lackluster 720p resolution, but with nary a hitch. There's no way I'd spend $10 a month or $60 a year for that experience \u2014 not when I can own those same games permanently for $10 or less per disc \u2014 but I would pay if Sony gave me the latest games there. Better yet, I'd pay to get games that aren't even possible on console, with hundreds or thousands of simultaneous players, incredibly advanced physics simulations, and AI voiced NPCs that don't just repeat the same pre programmed lines of dialogue. It's not clear whether Sony has any intent to do so \u2014 and now it'll have to fight its own ideas in the hands of much wealthier adversaries like Google. All we know for sure is that the PlayStation 5 is coming, and Sony has a vague interest in maximizing the \"off console opportunity\" of cloud gaming as well.\nIn 2014, Perry claimed that Sony had \"fully greenlit\" a project where Gaikai would help build \"the fastest global network ever made\" to let gamers play like never before. That may still be the plan, but Sony's going to need some help. That may be why it struck a cloud gaming partnership with Microsoft this May, teaming up with its chief rival.\nSony was one of the few companies that believed in cloud gaming enough to spend big in 2012, just as it was one of the few that believed in VR. But that wasn't enough to make Sony a leader.\nRelated\nMicrosoft and Sony are teaming up for the future of gaming\nPlayStation 25th anniversary issue Hardware 4 How the PlayStation's DualShock shaped modern controllers The rise and fall of the PlayStation supercomputers Remember how simple consoles used to be with this original PlayStation teardown The portable PlayStations were Sony at its most ambitious Games and culture 6 One of PlayStation's most important studios makes games about loneliness Naughty Dog's president on how games changed since the first PlayStation: 'They're barely recognizable' How to play classic PlayStation games in 2019 Why Final Fantasy became the face of Sony's first PlayStation How the PlayStation logo became a streetwear icon The PlayStation 3 was Blu ray's ultimate Trojan horse", "URL": "https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"}]}, {"client": "LATAM AIRLINES GROUP | GB0017Y7", "industry": "Retail", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 43.0, "market": "SSA", "products": "Google Cloud Platform", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "LIBERTY MEDIA CORPORATION | GB00186K", "industry": "Retail", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 672.0, "market": "US", "products": "Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud Platform", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Strong", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "ATOS | GB001BM3", "industry": "Computer Services", "segment": "Commercial", "intensity": 2.0, "market": "India-South Asia", "products": "Google Cloud Platform", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "JOHN LEWIS PARTNERSHIP | GB001GU2", "industry": "Retail", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 65.0, "market": "UKI", "products": "Google Cloud Platform", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "FEDERAL HOME LOAN | GB001JR4", "industry": "Banking", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 2.0, "market": "US", "products": "Google Cloud Deployment Manager", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "USG RESTRICTED  01 | GB0WPN13", "industry": "Government, Central/Federal", "segment": "Industry", "intensity": 145.0, "market": "US", "products": "Google Cloud Platform", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Neutral", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY - SHAW INDUSTRIES GROUP | GB227545", "industry": "Wholesale Distribution & Services", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 72.0, "market": "US", "products": "Google Cloud Platform", "score": 0.0, "relationshipStrength": "Weak", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": []}, {"client": "TWITTER INC | GB227FZ8", "industry": "Media & Entertainment", "segment": "Enterprise", "intensity": 146.0, "market": "US", "products": "Google Cloud Dataflow", "score": 1193.0, "relationshipStrength": "Strong", "lastUpdated": "1/06/20", "news": [{"Title": "AMD Launches 2nd Generation EPYC Processers for Servers and Datacenters", "Text": "Welcome Stranger to OCC!

These are using the new 7 nm Zen2 cores and chiplets present in the Ryzen 3000 series of processors, and thanks to the smaller process technology the lineup includes a 64 core/128 thread part. All of the processors, even the 8 core/16 thread parts offer 128 PCIe 4.0 lanes, eight DDR4 memory channels and support for up to 3200 MHz memory.\nAt the top of the stack is the EPYC 7742, one of three 64 core/128 thread parts with a base clock of 2.25 GHz, a boost of 3.40 GHz, and a TDP of 225 W. That can be had for $6950, while at the bottom of the stack is the 7232P, the cheapest of the three 8 core/16 thread processors at $450. The EPYC 7232P has a base clock of 3.10 GHz and a boost of 3.20 GHz with a TDP of 120 W.\nWhile these might not be the processors we will install and use in our computers, they can give us some insight to what the upcoming Threadripper 3000 series of HEDT processors will be able to offer. Also, server parts like EPYC can generate a great deal of revenue for chip manufacturers, so the news that both Google and Twitter are going to be adopting EPYC processors is important as the sales could be used to fund development for still more amazing components in the future. Google has deployed these new EPYC processors in its internal infrastructure production datacenter and later this year will be adding it to the Google Cloud Compute Engine. Twitter will be deploying the CPUs later this year to reduce its total cost of ownership by 25%.

Jens Kalaene\u2014picture alliance via Getty Images)\nShortly after news of a data breach at Capital One came out, I received a call from Timothy Eades, chief executive of vArmour, a startup that helps companies manage security across so called public and private clouds. He sounded exasperated.\n\"Everyone has been deaf, dumb, and blind moving to the cloud. They think it's safe, convenient, easy\u2014that they've moved to the happy place,\" Eades told me. The point he stressed: Even after a company taps into the cloud\u2014that buzzy nickname for the remotely managed computing resources offered by the likes of Amazon , Microsoft , Google , and others\u2014it retains responsibilities. IT professionals cannot wipe their hands of infrastructure upkeep concerns completely.\nFollowing that call, I wrote a piece for the latest issue of Fortune , published online this morning, which asks, \" After the Capital One Breach, Should Big Business Fear the Public Cloud? \" Generally, as just about every cybersecurity expert I spoke to underscored, the answer is, No.\nThe advantages of the cloud are simply too compelling. Businesses can tap the on demand storage and computing resources they need when they need, thereby reducing waste. Dedicated, crack teams take care of most patching and software updates. The cloud is undeniably convenient and, more importantly, better in terms of security than what the majority of companies can achieve alone.\nDon't take it from me\u2014take it from a practitioner. \"People have been suggesting that there's something inherently bad about cloud infrastructure and I, frankly, think it's just the opposite,\" Edward Amoroso, the former chief security officer of AT&T , told me. (The telecom giant, it must be noted, knows a thing or two about managing complex IT systems.)\nEven Capital One attributes its ability to recover quickly from its breach to its embracement of the cloud. As Sie Soheili, a Capital One spokesperson, emphasized in bolded text in an email to me: \" The speed with which we were able to diagnose and fix this vulnerability, and determine its effect, was enabled by our cloud operating model.\"\nI wondered, upon reading that statement, whether Capital One had no other choice but to double down on a cloud endorsement, given how far down the rabbit hole it has ventured since it began its IT migration five years ago. (On an earnings call earlier this year, CEO Richard Fairbank said he planned to eliminate the last of the bank's data centers in favor of the cloud by 2020.) But even that default posture of journalistic skepticism cannot counter the truth: Moving some portion of one's operations to the cloud is no cybersecurity panacea, but it is, in most cases, an obvious boon.\nRobert Hackett | @rhhackett | robert.hackett@fortune.com THREATS\nPrivacy gaslighting.

Designed to meet the expectations of today's workforce, Capacity is a cloud based system built on AI that captures, mines and connects organizational knowledge to maximize employee productivity. The company also announced that it raised $13.2 million in Series B funding from a Midwest network of private and angel investors to help support company growth and scale its technology. \"We couldn't be more excited to launch our AI powered knowledge sharing platform under the new Capacity brand,\" said David Karandish , CoFounder and CEO of Capacity. \"We chose the name Capacity because we firmly believe that the more organizations share and leverage their knowledge, the greater capacity their teams will have to do outstanding work.\" Companies continue to invest billions of dollars into new applications, systems and databases to create more effective workplace environments. Unfortunately, these systems still aren't built for the way teams work today, frequently acting as yet another barrier between employees and the knowledge they need to excel in their work. Team members are forced to waste costly hours every day searching for information that's spread across dozens of systems, which reduces their capacity, engagement and overall satisfaction. Capacity addresses these challenges by capturing tacit knowledge, mining documents and spreadsheets and connecting to enterprise apps\u2014 making everything instantly accessible through a single, automated chat platform. \"In the banking industry, our workforce has to learn more and more, year after year because we continue to add various channels, products and ways our team can access information and conduct a transaction,\" said Jason Peach , President and CEO at West Community Credit Union. \"We introduced the Capacity platform to fill that void and ensure that our team has access to the information and knowledge they need.\" Capacity is on a mission to help teams do their best work, by making all organizational knowledge quick and easy to find, share and leverage. The platform also helps organizations work smarter as a whole through its AI assisted conversational workflows. Capacity adheres to industry standard security and data compliance protocols, such as SOC 2 and GDPR, and currently integrates with more than 50 of today's most popular workplace applications and platforms. Capacity's features include: Enterprise Search is a collection of connectors that allows companies to integrate with over 50 popular apps right out of the box, in addition to a Developer Platform to connect Capacity to custom and proprietary applications. LiveDocs enables Capacity to instantly mine information from documents, spreadsheets and webpages. Knowledge Base enables Capacity to pinpoint and capture the oftentimes hidden expertise within an organization\u2014 including who the organization's experts are.

No integrations or installs required. \"Today's workplace systems are not designed for how people actually work. Consumer grade tools like Netflix and Google have shown us that people prefer a personalized experience\u2014 but enterprise software hasn't kept up,\" said Karandish. \"We built our new product suite with our fellow consumer in mind, so that Capacity feels less like software you have to use, and more like software you want to use.\" New Financing, Raised From Local Midwest Community With its launch, the company officially rebranded from Jane.ai to Capacity to support its growth and expansion from a virtual assistant chatbot to a comprehensive knowledge sharing platform. In addition, Capacity has also raised $13.2 million in an oversubscribed Series B Funding round from a Midwest network of private and angel investors, including existing investors.

ending its exclusive distribution contract with Uber Eats and testing the waters with DoorDash. Travis Kalanick's (r emember him? ) brainchild has been the sole courier delivering delicious Big Macs (and apple pies) to cotton mouthed, red eyed customers since 2017.\nThe announcement is an obvious boon to DoorDash and a blow to Uber. The program will launch in Houston where DoorDash will have access to 200 Houston based Mickey D's which seems like entirely too many McDonalds for one city. If the program does well, it will likely expand to a national level.\nDoorDash is strictly a delivery company that operates in all 50 states and reaches 80% of Americans , which is what makes it so attractive to the golden arches according to Chris Kempczinski, Mcdonald's US President.\nIt be like that sometimes\nUber just got ham burgled. Even though the technology company delivers for 9k McDonald's throughout the country, representing more than half of the burger chain's domestic locations, this news has got to sting considering Uber recently agreed to lower commissions on deliveries in order to appease Ronald.\nAnd that's not all, McDonald's brass hinted that it would open up its delivery business to other services like GrubHub and Postmates.com\nFAT CLOUDS\nIBM and AT&T are joining forces for a cloud deal that those with inside baseball are saying is worth \"billions.\" According to IBM, the deal is multiyear and will allow AT&T to host business applications on the IBM cloud.\nSounds juicy \nWhile IBM has confirmed the deal is done, the exact value and length haven't been revealed.\nFor IBM, the W marks the first deal since it closed a $34B agreement with Red Hat last week. When that deal was initially being hammered out back in October, IBM said it was acquiring all of Red Hat's stock for $190 each in cash It was the largest deal ever for IBM.\nAT&T stands to benefit from that deal also, now that it's in bed with IBM. It'll gain access to Red Hat's platform in order to manage workloads and applications for enterprise customers.\nAT&T and IBM will also be developing edge computing platforms that leverage 5G networks and internet connected devices. So. Many. Buzzwords.\nPODDY TIME\nApple is taking a bigger bite of the podcast business, as the company plans to fund original podcasts that are exclusive to its sh*tty Podcasts app.\nApple first got into the biz back in 2005 but hasn't made many (read: any) updates since. That's starting to change, though, as the Podcast Analytics app was launched last year to give podcast makers insight into its listeners.\nAnd that's a f*ck ton of insight as approximately 50%to 70% of all podcast listeners utilize the Podcasts app. Even so, Apple doesn't make any money off of it because it doesn't run its own ads or charge for software. That was all well and good until iPhone sales started going the way of the Amazon Fire Phone.\nIt's easy to see why the Mac mafia is making the move, as the number of monthly listeners has doubled over the past five years and sales in the podcast industry have grown 65% over the past three.\nSpotify is seething\nSpotify, which is the number two player in the game behind Apple, is investing heavily in the podcast industry this year. CEO Daniel Ek stated in February that the company planned to spend between $400M and $500M on original podcasts this year including the $230M it paid to purchase Gimlet Media.\nSpotify's stock fell nearly 2% yesterday on the news.\nIN OTHER NEWS iStockphoto Shocker the masters of the universe are absolutely crushing it this earnings szn. That is, everyone except one bulge bracket bank. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase joined Citi in besting 2018 profit figures , due in large part to swelling consumer businesses. Goldman's bottom line, however, fell 6% vs. the same period last year thanks to underperforming underwriting and debt trading segments.\nPresident Trump reminded us yesterday that if he was the kind of guy who wanted to impose tariffs on China , he definitely could. This, of course, sent investors heading for the exits. The three major US indices closed in the red. As markets await a Fed rate cut, Donny Politics played Buzz Killington, noting that China has not lived up to its promise, made at the G20, to buy a boatload of US farm exports.\nPOTUS had a busy day moving markets. Oil futures fell nearly 4% on news that the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, indicated that Iran is ready to discuss its missile program. Of course, Pompeo didn't specify if the discussions involved high ranking Iranian military officials threatening to kill every man, woman, and child on the eastern seaboard. It's worth noting that Iran has indicated that its missile program is non negotiable.\n\" Leave Bill alone! \" The publicly traded fund of famed activist investor, and Herbalife hater, Bill Ackman has an activist investor of its own. Define \"irony.\" AVI , which owns roughly 3% of The Ack Man's publicly traded fund is pushing back on the proposed issuance of $400M in 20 year debt. AVI claims the Pershing Square Holdings fund is already over leveraged.\nReady to become the most well informed bro in any room? You can subscribe here.

[{"Title": "D2IQ Is Ready To Ramp Channel Engagement With Its First Partner Program", "Text": "News, Analysis and Perspective for Solution Providers and Technology Integrators D2IQ Is Ready To Ramp Channel Engagement With Its First Partner Program Having rebranded and refocused on Kubernetes in 2019, the innovative container tech startup previously called Mesosphere looks to recruit DevOps focused solution providers with a 'landing pad' for cloud native modernization projects. By Joseph Tsidulko December 24, 2019, 09:13 AM EST\nAfter executing a shift in branding and focus, D2IQ is ready to engage the channel in a way the container tech startup has never done before.\nKnown as Mesosphere until last August, the innovative company transformed in 2019 to build on its core strength of helping organizations implement containerized architectures and big data workloads at scale while adding emphasis on Kubernetes, a technology that rivals the one its founders created.\nWhen Joe Taborek joined as chief revenue officer six months ago, he saw that it wasn't just branding and technological focus that needed to change at the San Francisco based startup, but also channel engagement.\n[Related: The 10 Hottest Kubernetes Tools And Technologies Of 2019 ]\n\"We had some channel and partner success, probably in spite of ourselves,\" Taborek, a former sales executive at Accenture, told CRN. \"But I was not satisfied with how the program was set up. It was pretty immature.\"\nA couple of weeks ago, D2IQ introduced its first formal partner program with new on boarding mechanisms, deal registration incentives and partner enablement paths.\nWith the new program in place, Taborek and his team are busy recruiting partners, especially those who specialize in DevOps and DevSecOps consulting and cloud native modernization projects.\nD2IQ, with its container and big data offerings, gives partners a software platform \"to land those customer projects on,\" Taborek told CRN.\nMesosphere was founded by the creators of the open source Mesos container orchestrator\u2014a technology that has been deployed to handle some heavy duty containerized workloads at places like Twitter, Airbnb and eBay.\n\"Mesos is still the best product in the world to do certain things,\" Taborek said. \"But the market spoke loudly.\"\nKubernetes, a competing container orchestrator that sprung out of Google, became a de facto standard, forcing Mesosphere to change its name and its strategy.\nMesosphere, however, was never all about Mesos.\nIts flagship product that launched six years ago, the Data Center Operating System, or DC/OS, integrated a lot of open source container and big data technologies with expertise deploying them at scale for online services giants and other large customers.\nWith the rebranding to D2IQ\u2014spoken internally as \"Day 2 IQ\" to reflect the focus on ongoing management of production deployments\u2014the company introduced Ksphere, a stand alone Kubernetes platform.\nAt the same time, D2IQ repositioned Mesosphere as its Mesos oriented product incorporating the innovations of the DC/OS platform. Rounding out the portfolio is Datasphere, a platform that implements staple data services like Kafka, Spark and Cassandra.\nThose solutions all emphasize the \"industrial nature of running containers at scale,\" Taborek told CRN.\nHeading into 2020 with a revamped product suite featuring a clear Kubernetes platform, D2IQ plans to tilt its go to market model away from direct sales, Taborek said.\nIn North America, the company currently sees just more than 20 percent of bookings through partners, and in Europe slightly more than 50 percent. But Taborek aims to realize the majority of global sales through the channel.\n\"We very much want to grow the business on the back of partners,\" he said, adding enterprises running Kubernetes at production scale want a trusted solution provider to support their cloud native infrastructure.\nD2IQ believes Ksphere delivers to partners a unique advantage over other managed Kubernetes services because it stays close to the open source project while incorporating two homegrown technologies, Konvoy and Kommander, that enable rapid deployment and federated management.\n\"Red Hat and Pivotal have become increasingly proprietary over time,\" he said of two prominent Kubernetes vendors. (Red Hat was acquired by IBM this year, and Pivotal by VMware.)\nTaborek told CRN that channel program development and partner engagement has been his top focus since joining the company. The next step, he said, will be hiring a channel chief to further advance those efforts.
